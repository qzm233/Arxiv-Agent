        "abstract": "The widespread usage of large-scale multimodal models like CLIP has\nheightened concerns about the leakage of personally identifiable information\n(PII). Existing methods for identity inference in CLIP models, i.e., to detect\nthe presence of a person's PII used for training a CLIP model, require querying\nthe model with full PII, including textual descriptions of the person and\ncorresponding images (e.g., the name and the face photo of the person).\nHowever, this may lead to potential privacy breach of the image, as it may have\nnot been seen by the target model yet. Additionally, traditional membership\ninference attacks (MIAs) train shadow models to mimic the behaviors of the\ntarget model, which incurs high computational costs, especially for large CLIP\nmodels. To address these challenges, we propose a textual unimodal detector\n(TUNI) in CLIP models, a novel method for ID inference that 1) queries the\ntarget model with only text data; and 2) does not require training shadow\nmodels. Firstly, we develop a feature extraction algorithm, guided by the CLIP\nmodel, to extract features from a text description. TUNI starts with randomly\ngenerating textual gibberish that were clearly not utilized for training, and\nleverages their feature vectors to train a system of anomaly detectors. During\ninference, the feature vector of each test text is fed into the anomaly\ndetectors to determine if the person's PII is in the training set (abnormal) or\nnot (normal). Moreover, TUNI can be further strengthened integrating real\nimages associated with the tested individuals, if available at the detector.\nExtensive experiments of TUNI across various CLIP model architectures and\ndatasets demonstrate its superior performance over baselines, albeit with only\ntext data.",

        "abstract": "Affordance grounding aims to localize the interaction regions for the\nmanipulated objects in the scene image according to given instructions. A\ncritical challenge in affordance grounding is that the embodied agent should\nunderstand human instructions and analyze which tools in the environment can be\nused, as well as how to use these tools to accomplish the instructions. Most\nrecent works primarily supports simple action labels as input instructions for\nlocalizing affordance regions, failing to capture complex human objectives.\nMoreover, these approaches typically identify affordance regions of only a\nsingle object in object-centric images, ignoring the object context and\nstruggling to localize affordance regions of multiple objects in complex scenes\nfor practical applications. To address this concern, for the first time, we\nintroduce a new task of affordance grounding based on natural language\ninstructions, extending it from previously using simple labels for complex\nhuman instructions. For this new task, we propose a new framework, WorldAfford.\nWe design a novel Affordance Reasoning Chain-of-Thought Prompting to reason\nabout affordance knowledge from LLMs more precisely and logically.\nSubsequently, we use SAM and CLIP to localize the objects related to the\naffordance knowledge in the image. We identify the affordance regions of the\nobjects through an affordance region localization module. To benchmark this new\ntask and validate our framework, an affordance grounding dataset, LLMaFF, is\nconstructed. We conduct extensive experiments to verify that WorldAfford\nperforms state-of-the-art on both the previous AGD20K and the new LLMaFF\ndataset. In particular, WorldAfford can localize the affordance regions of\nmultiple objects and provide an alternative when objects in the environment\ncannot fully match the given instruction.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in image understanding have benefited from the extensive\nuse of web image-text pairs. However, video understanding remains a challenge\ndespite the availability of substantial web video-text data. This difficulty\nprimarily arises from the inherent complexity of videos and the inefficient\nlanguage supervision in recent web-collected video-text datasets. In this\npaper, we introduce Text-Only Pre-Alignment (TOPA), a novel approach to extend\nlarge language models (LLMs) for video understanding, without the need for\npre-training on real video data. Specifically, we first employ an advanced LLM\nto automatically generate Textual Videos comprising continuous textual frames,\nalong with corresponding annotations to simulate real video-text data. Then,\nthese annotated textual videos are used to pre-align a language-only LLM with\nthe video modality. To bridge the gap between textual and real videos, we\nemploy the CLIP model as the feature extractor to align image and text\nmodalities. During text-only pre-alignment, the continuous textual frames,\nencoded as a sequence of CLIP text features, are analogous to continuous CLIP\nimage features, thus aligning the LLM with real video representation. Extensive\nexperiments, including zero-shot evaluation and finetuning on various video\nunderstanding tasks, demonstrate that TOPA is an effective and efficient\nframework for aligning video content with LLMs. In particular, without training\non any video data, the TOPA-Llama2-13B model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 51.0%\non the challenging long-form video understanding benchmark, Egoschema.

Consequently, this undermines the efficiency of developers\nin locating and rectifying defects. Furthermore, in practical software\ndevelopment, new projects often lack sufficient defect data to train\nhigh-accuracy deep learning models. Models trained on historical data from\nexisting projects frequently struggle to achieve satisfactory generalization\nperformance on new projects. Hence, this paper initially reformulates the\ntraditional binary defect prediction task into a multi-label classification\nproblem, employing defect categories described in the Common Weakness\nEnumeration (CWE) as fine-grained predictive labels. To enhance the model\nperformance in cross-project scenarios, this paper proposes a multi-source\ndomain adaptation framework that integrates adversarial training and attention\nmechanisms. Specifically, the proposed framework employs adversarial training\nto mitigate domain (i.e., software projects) discrepancies, and further\nutilizes domain-invariant features to capture feature correlations between each\nsource domain and the target domain. Simultaneously, the proposed framework\nemploys a weighted maximum mean discrepancy as an attention mechanism to\nminimize the representation distance between source and target domain features,\nfacilitating model in learning more domain-independent features. The\nexperiments on 8 real-world open-source projects show that the proposed\napproach achieves significant performance improvements compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

The size of the state-of-the-art models has increased\nsteadily reaching billions of parameters. These huge models are memory hungry\nand incur significant inference latency even on cutting edge AI-accelerators,\nsuch as GPUs. Specifically, the time and memory complexity of the attention\noperation is quadratic in terms of the total context length, i.e., prompt and\noutput tokens. Thus, several optimizations such as key-value tensor caching and\nFlashAttention computation have been proposed to deliver the low latency\ndemands of applications relying on such large models. However, these techniques\ndo not cater to the computationally distinct nature of different phases during\ninference.\n  To that end, we propose LeanAttention, a scalable technique of computing\nself-attention for the token-generation phase (decode-phase) of decoder-only\ntransformer models. LeanAttention enables scaling the attention mechanism\nimplementation for the challenging case of long context lengths by re-designing\nthe execution flow for the decode-phase. We identify that the associative\nproperty of online softmax can be treated as a reduction operation thus\nallowing us to parallelize the attention computation over these large context\nlengths. We extend the \"stream-K\" style reduction of tiled calculation to\nself-attention to enable parallel computation resulting in an average of 2.6x\nattention execution speedup over FlashAttention-2 and up to 8.33x speedup for\n512k context lengths.",

Existing GMAE models primarily\nfocus on reconstructing node-level information, categorizing them as\nsingle-scale GMAEs. This methodology, while effective in certain contexts,\ntends to overlook the complex hierarchical structures inherent in many\nreal-world graphs. For instance, molecular graphs exhibit a clear hierarchical\norganization in the form of the atoms-functional groups-molecules structure.\nHence, the inability of single-scale GMAE models to incorporate these\nhierarchical relationships often leads to their inadequate capture of crucial\nhigh-level graph information, resulting in a noticeable decline in performance.\nTo address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Graph Masked AutoEncoders\n(Hi-GMAE), a novel multi-scale GMAE framework designed to handle the\nhierarchical structures within graphs. First, Hi-GMAE constructs a multi-scale\ngraph hierarchy through graph pooling, enabling the exploration of graph\nstructures across different granularity levels. To ensure masking uniformity of\nsubgraphs across these scales, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine strategy that\ninitiates masking at the coarsest scale and progressively back-projects the\nmask to the finer scales. Furthermore, we integrate a gradual recovery strategy\nwith the masking process to mitigate the learning challenges posed by\ncompletely masked subgraphs. Diverging from the standard graph neural network\n(GNN) used in GMAE models, Hi-GMAE modifies its encoder and decoder into\nhierarchical structures. This entails using GNN at the finer scales for\ndetailed local graph analysis and employing a graph transformer at coarser\nscales to capture global information.

Message passing neural networks, which learn\nrepresentations through recursively aggregating information from each node and\nits neighbors, are among the most commonly-used GNNs. However, a wealth of\nstructural information of individual nodes and full graphs is often ignored in\nsuch process, which restricts the expressive power of GNNs. Various graph data\naugmentation methods that enable the message passing with richer structure\nknowledge have been introduced as one main way to tackle this issue, but they\nare often focused on individual structure features and difficult to scale up\nwith more structure features. In this work we propose a novel approach, namely\ncollective structure knowledge-augmented graph neural network (CoS-GNN), in\nwhich a new message passing method is introduced to allow GNNs to harness a\ndiverse set of node- and graph-level structure features, together with original\nnode features/attributes, in augmented graphs. In doing so, our approach\nlargely improves the structural knowledge modeling of GNNs in both node and\ngraph levels, resulting in substantially improved graph representations. This\nis justified by extensive empirical results where CoS-GNN outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in various graph-level learning tasks, including graph\nclassification, anomaly detection, and out-of-distribution generalization.",

This has motivated research into machine learning models\nthat can predict, for a given SAT instance, which solver to select among\nseveral options. Existing SAT solver selection methods all rely on some\nhand-picked instance features, which are costly to compute and ignore the\nstructural information in SAT graphs. In this paper we present GraSS, a novel\napproach for automatic SAT solver selection based on tripartite graph\nrepresentations of instances and a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN)\nmodel. While GNNs have been previously adopted in other SAT-related tasks, they\ndo not incorporate any domain-specific knowledge and ignore the runtime\nvariation introduced by different clause orders. We enrich the graph\nrepresentation with domain-specific decisions, such as novel node feature\ndesign, positional encodings for clauses in the graph, a GNN architecture\ntailored to our tripartite graphs and a runtime-sensitive loss function.\nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this combination of raw\nrepresentations and domain-specific choices leads to improvements in runtime\nfor a pool of seven state-of-the-art solvers on both an industrial circuit\ndesign benchmark, and on instances from the 20-year Anniversary Track of the\n2022 SAT Competition.",

        "abstract": "Current multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from\n``hallucination'', occasionally generating responses that are not grounded in\nthe input images. To tackle this challenge, one promising path is to utilize\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which steers MLLMs towards\nlearning superior responses while avoiding inferior ones. We rethink the common\npractice of using binary preferences (\\emph{i.e.}, superior, inferior), and\nfind that adopting multi-level preferences (\\emph{e.g.}, superior, medium,\ninferior) is better for two benefits: 1) It narrows the gap between adjacent\nlevels, thereby encouraging MLLMs to discern subtle differences. 2) It further\nintegrates cross-level comparisons (beyond adjacent-level comparisons), thus\nproviding a broader range of comparisons with hallucination examples. To verify\nour viewpoint, we present the Automated Multi-level Preference (\\textbf{AMP})\nframework for MLLMs. To facilitate this framework, we first develop an\nautomated dataset generation pipeline that provides high-quality multi-level\npreference datasets without any human annotators. Furthermore, we design the\nMulti-level Direct Preference Optimization (MDPO) algorithm to robustly conduct\ncomplex multi-level preference learning.

Leveraging Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) proves\neffective and is widely adopted by researchers.

Furthermore, prevailing approaches to\npreference alignment primarily concentrate on pairwise comparisons, with\nlimited exploration into multi-response scenarios, thereby overlooking the\npotential richness within the candidate pool. For the above reasons, we propose\na new approach: Listwise Reward Enhancement for Preference Alignment (LIRE), a\ngradient-based reward optimization approach that incorporates the offline\nrewards of multiple responses into a streamlined listwise framework, thus\neliminating the need for online sampling during training. LIRE is\nstraightforward to implement, requiring minimal parameter tuning, and\nseamlessly aligns with the pairwise paradigm while naturally extending to\nmulti-response scenarios. Moreover, we introduce a self-enhancement algorithm\naimed at iteratively refining the reward during training. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that LIRE consistently outperforms existing methods across several\nbenchmarks on dialogue and summarization tasks, with good transferability to\nout-of-distribution data, assessed using proxy reward models and human\nannotators.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a novel power control solution for\nsubnetworks-enabled distributed control systems in factory settings. We propose\na channel-independent control-aware (CICA) policy based on the logistic model\nand learn the parameters using Bayesian optimization with a multi-objective\ntree-structured Parzen estimator. The objective is to minimize the control cost\nof the plants, measured as a finite horizon linear quadratic regulator cost.\nThe proposed policy can be executed in a fully distributed manner and does not\nrequire cumbersome measurement of channel gain information, hence it is\nscalable for large-scale deployment of subnetworks for distributed control\napplications. With extensive numerical simulation and considering different\ndensities of subnetworks, we show that the proposed method can achieve\ncompetitive stability performance and high availability for large-scale\ndistributed control plants with limited radio resources.",

LNPS is a\nmetaheuristic that starts with an initial solution and then iteratively tries\nto find better solutions by alternately destroying and prioritized searching\nfor a current solution. Due to the variability of neighborhoods, LNPS allows\nfor flexible search without strongly depending on the destroy operators. We\npresent an implementation of LNPS based on ASP.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate nonlinear optimization problems whose\nconstraints are defined as fuzzy relational equations (FRE) with max-min\ncomposition. Since the feasible solution set of the FRE is often a non-convex\nset and the resolution of the FREs is an NP-hard problem, conventional\nnonlinear approaches may involve high computational complexity. Based on the\ntheoretical aspects of the problem, an algorithm (called FRE-ACO algorithm) is\npresented which benefits from the structural properties of the FREs, the\nability of discrete ant colony optimization algorithm (denoted by ACO) to\ntackle combinatorial problems, and that of continuous ant colony optimization\nalgorithm (denoted by ACOR) to solve continuous optimization problems. In the\ncurrent method, the fundamental ideas underlying ACO and ACOR are combined and\nform an efficient approach to solve the nonlinear optimization problems\nconstrained with such non-convex regions. Moreover, FRE-ACO algorithm preserves\nthe feasibility of new generated solutions without having to initially find the\nminimal solutions of the feasible region or check the feasibility after\ngenerating the new solutions. FRE-ACO algorithm has been compared with some\nrelated works proposed for solving nonlinear optimization problems with respect\nto maxmin FREs. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm\nhas a higher convergence rate and requires a less number of function\nevaluations compared to other considered algorithms.",

        "abstract": "We study joint optimization of service placement, request routing, and CPU\nsizing in a cooperative MEC system. The problem is considered from the\nperspective of the service provider (SP), which delivers heterogeneous\nMEC-enabled delay-sensitive services, and needs to pay for the used resources\nto the mobile network operators and the cloud provider, while earning revenue\nfrom the served requests. We formulate the problem of maximizing the SP's total\nprofit subject to the computation, storage, and communication constraints of\neach edge node and end-to-end delay requirements of the services as a\nmixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, and prove it to be NP-hard.\n  To tackle the challenges in solving the problem, we first introduce a design\ntrade-off parameter for different delay requirements of each service, which\nmaintains flexibility in prioritizing them, and transform the original\noptimization problem by the new delay constraints. Then, by exploiting a hidden\nconvexity, we reformulate the delay constraints into an equivalent form. Next,\nto handle the challenge of the complicating (integer) variables, using primal\ndecomposition, we decompose the problem into an equivalent form of master and\ninner sub-problems over the mixed and real variables, respectively. We then\nemploy a cutting-plane approach for building up adequate representations of the\nextremal value of the inner problem as a function of the complicating variables\nand the set of values of the complicating variables for which the inner problem\nis feasible. Finally, we propose a solution strategy based on generalized\nBenders decomposition and prove its convergence to the optimal solution within\na limited number of iterations. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that\nthe proposed scheme significantly outperforms the existing mechanisms in terms\nof the SP's profit, cache hit ratio, running time, and end-to-end delay.",

This optimization\nsetting is known as safe optimization and formulated as a specialized type of\nconstrained optimization problem with constraints for safety functions. Safe\noptimization requires performing efficient optimization without evaluating\nunsafe solutions. A few studies have proposed the optimization methods for safe\noptimization based on Bayesian optimization and the evolutionary algorithm.\nHowever, Bayesian optimization-based methods often struggle to achieve superior\nsolutions, and the evolutionary algorithm-based method fails to effectively\nreduce unsafe evaluations. This study focuses on CMA-ES as an efficient\nevolutionary algorithm and proposes an optimization method termed safe CMA-ES.\nThe safe CMA-ES is designed to achieve both safety and efficiency in safe\noptimization. The safe CMA-ES estimates the Lipschitz constants of safety\nfunctions transformed with the distribution parameters using the maximum norm\nof the gradient in Gaussian process regression. Subsequently, the safe CMA-ES\nprojects the samples to the nearest point in the safe region constructed with\nthe estimated Lipschitz constants. The numerical simulation using the benchmark\nfunctions shows that the safe CMA-ES successfully performs optimization,\nsuppressing the unsafe evaluations, while the existing methods struggle to\nsignificantly reduce the unsafe evaluations.",

As a result, the approximation of the true gradient in\nthis scheme is biased, but it prevents commonly encountered algorithmic\nproblems, such as exploding variance in the one-bit compression regime,\ndeterioration of performance in the case of sparse gradients, and restrictive\nassumptions on the distribution of the stochastic gradients.
