        "abstract": "Offline policy evaluation (OPE) allows us to evaluate and estimate a new\nsequential decision-making policy's performance by leveraging historical\ninteraction data collected from other policies. Evaluating a new policy online\nwithout a confident estimate of its performance can lead to costly, unsafe, or\nhazardous outcomes, especially in education and healthcare. Several OPE\nestimators have been proposed in the last decade, many of which have\nhyperparameters and require training. Unfortunately, choosing the best OPE\nalgorithm for each task and domain is still unclear. In this paper, we propose\na new algorithm that adaptively blends a set of OPE estimators given a dataset\nwithout relying on an explicit selection using a statistical procedure. We\nprove that our estimator is consistent and satisfies several desirable\nproperties for policy evaluation. Additionally, we demonstrate that when\ncompared to alternative approaches, our estimator can be used to select\nhigher-performing policies in healthcare and robotics. Our work contributes to\nimproving ease of use for a general-purpose, estimator-agnostic, off-policy\nevaluation framework for offline RL.",

        "abstract": "We present DC-Gaussian, a new method for generating novel views from\nin-vehicle dash cam videos. While neural rendering techniques have made\nsignificant strides in driving scenarios, existing methods are primarily\ndesigned for videos collected by autonomous vehicles. However, these videos are\nlimited in both quantity and diversity compared to dash cam videos, which are\nmore widely used across various types of vehicles and capture a broader range\nof scenarios. Dash cam videos often suffer from severe obstructions such as\nreflections and occlusions on the windshields, which significantly impede the\napplication of neural rendering techniques. To address this challenge, we\ndevelop DC-Gaussian based on the recent real-time neural rendering technique 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach includes an adaptive image\ndecomposition module to model reflections and occlusions in a unified manner.\nAdditionally, we introduce illumination-aware obstruction modeling to manage\nreflections and occlusions under varying lighting conditions. Lastly, we employ\na geometry-guided Gaussian enhancement strategy to improve rendering details by\nincorporating additional geometry priors. Experiments on self-captured and\npublic dash cam videos show that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in novel view synthesis, but also accurately reconstructing\ncaptured scenes getting rid of obstructions.",

To test the\nrobustness, we then conducted a case study of the EV market in Los Angeles (LA)\nCounty, which suggests that a 1% increase in EVCS correlates with a 0.35%\nincrease in EV sales. Additionally, we forecasted the future EV market dynamics\nin LA County, revealing a notable disparity between current policies and the\ntargeted 80% EV market share for private cars by 2045. To bridge this gap, we\nproposed a combined policy recommendation that enhances EV incentives by 60%\nand EVCS rebates by 66%, facilitating the achievement of future EV market\nobjectives.",

        "abstract": "Using drones to track multiple individuals simultaneously in their natural\nenvironment is a powerful approach for better understanding group primate\nbehavior. Previous studies have demonstrated that it is possible to automate\nthe classification of primate behavior from video data, but these studies have\nbeen carried out in captivity or from ground-based cameras. To understand group\nbehavior and the self-organization of a collective, the whole troop needs to be\nseen at a scale where behavior can be seen in relation to the natural\nenvironment in which ecological decisions are made. This study presents a novel\ndataset from drone videos for baboon detection, tracking, and behavior\nrecognition. The baboon detection dataset was created by manually annotating\nall baboons in drone videos with bounding boxes. A tiling method was\nsubsequently applied to create a pyramid of images at various scales from the\noriginal 5.3K resolution images, resulting in approximately 30K images used for\nbaboon detection. The tracking dataset is derived from the detection dataset,\nwhere all bounding boxes are assigned the same ID throughout the video. This\nprocess resulted in half an hour of very dense tracking data. The behavior\nrecognition dataset was generated by converting tracks into mini-scenes, a\nvideo subregion centered on each animal; each mini-scene was manually annotated\nwith 12 distinct behavior types, resulting in over 20 hours of data. Benchmark\nresults show mean average precision (mAP) of 92.62\\% for the YOLOv8-X detection\nmodel, multiple object tracking precision (MOTA) of 63.81\\% for the BotSort\ntracking algorithm, and micro top-1 accuracy of 63.97\\% for the X3D behavior\nrecognition model. Using deep learning to classify wildlife behavior from drone\nfootage facilitates non-invasive insight into the collective behavior of an\nentire group.",

The results demonstrate the potential of P4, as it\noutperforms the state-of-the-art of differential private P2P by up to 40\npercent in terms of accuracy. We also show the practicality of P4 by\nimplementing it on resource constrained devices, and validating that it has\nminimal overhead, e.g., about 7 seconds to run collaborative training between\ntwo clients.",

The noise is measured over a wide range of bias\nconditions and geometries to generate a comprehensive overview of LFN in this\ntechnology. While the RT results are in-line with the literature and the\nfoundry models, the cryogenic behavior diverges in many aspects. These\ndeviations include changes with respect to RT in magnitude and bias dependence\nthat are conditional on transistor type and geometry, and even an additional\nsystematic Lorentzian feature that is common among individual devices.\nFurthermore, we find the scaling of the average LFN with the area and its\nvariability to be similar between RT and 4.2 K, with the cryogenic scaling\nreported systematically for the first time. The findings suggest that, as no\nconsistent decrease of LFN at lower temperatures is observed while the white\nnoise is reduced, the impact of LFN for precision analog design at cryogenic\ntemperatures gains a more predominant role.",

JSON is commonly used for storing and transmitting\ninformation such as program configurations, web API requests and responses, or\nremote procedure calls; or data records, such as healthcare information or\nother structured documents. Since JSON is a plaintext format with potentially\nhighly complex definitions, it can be an arduous process to change code which\nhandles structured JSON data when its storage or transmission schemas are\nmodified. Our work describes a program synthesis method to generate a program\nthat accepts data conforming to a given input JSON Schema and automatically\nconverts it to conform to a resulting, target JSON Schema. We use a top-down,\ntype-directed approach to search for programs using a set of rewrite rules\nwhich constrain the ways in which a schema can be modified without unintended\ndata loss or corruption. Once a satisfying sequence of rewrites has been found,\nwe pass an intermediate representation of the rewrite sequence to a code\ngeneration backend, which synthesizes a program which executes the data\ntransformation.

        "abstract": "Understanding multi-agent behavior is critical across various fields. The\nconventional approach involves analyzing agent movements through three primary\ntasks: trajectory prediction, imputation, and spatial-temporal recovery.\nConsidering the unique input formulation and constraint of these tasks, most\nexisting methods are tailored to address only one specific task. However, in\nreal-world applications, these scenarios frequently occur simultaneously.\nConsequently, methods designed for one task often fail to adapt to others,\nresulting in performance drops. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\nUnified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary\ntrajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios. Specifically, we\nintroduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module embedded within a Transformer\nencoder for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent successful\nState Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional\nTemporal Mamba to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we\nincorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to comprehensively\nscan trajectories while maintaining the temporal missing relationships within\nthe sequence. We curate and benchmark three practical sports game datasets,\nBasketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our model. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work that addresses this unified problem through a\nversatile generative framework, thereby enhancing our understanding of\nmulti-agent movement.

Although foundation models were reported to have exceptional zero-shot\ngeneralization, they are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations.\nExisting methods achieve a comparable good tradeoff between zero-shot\nadversarial robustness and generalization under small adversarial\nperturbations. However, they fail to achieve a good tradeoff under large\nadversarial perturbations. To this end, we propose a novel Text-Image Mutual\nAwareness (TIMA) method that strikes a balance between zero-shot adversarial\nrobustness and generalization. More precisely, we propose an Image-Aware Text\n(IAT) tuning mechanism that increases the inter-class distance of text\nembeddings by incorporating the Minimum Hyperspherical Energy (MHE).\nSimultaneously, fixed pre-trained image embeddings are used as cross-modal\nauxiliary supervision to maintain the similarity between the MHE-tuned and\noriginal text embeddings by the knowledge distillation, preserving semantic\ninformation between different classes. Besides, we introduce a Text-Aware Image\n(TAI) tuning mechanism, which increases inter-class distance between image\nembeddings during the training stage by Text-distance based Adaptive Margin\n(TAM). Similarly, a knowledge distillation is utilized to retain the similarity\nbetween fine-tuned and pre-trained image embeddings.

        "abstract": "Prior work has offered evidence for functional localization in the brain;\ndifferent anatomical regions preferentially activate for certain types of\nvisual input. For example, the fusiform face area preferentially activates for\nvisual stimuli that include a face. However, the spectrum of visual semantics\nis extensive, and only a few semantically-tuned patches of cortex have so far\nbeen identified in the human brain. Using a multimodal (natural language and\nimage) neural network architecture (CLIP) we train a highly accurate\ncontrastive model that maps brain responses during naturalistic image viewing\nto CLIP embeddings. We then use a novel adaptation of the DBSCAN clustering\nalgorithm to cluster the parameters of these participant-specific contrastive\nmodels. This reveals what we call Shared Decodable Concepts (SDCs): clusters in\nCLIP space that are decodable from common sets of voxels across multiple\nparticipants.\n  Examining the images most and least associated with each SDC cluster gives us\nadditional insight into the semantic properties of each SDC. We note SDCs for\npreviously reported visual features (e.g. orientation tuning in early visual\ncortex) as well as visual semantic concepts such as faces, places and bodies.\nIn cases where our method finds multiple clusters for a visuo-semantic concept,\nthe least associated images allow us to dissociate between confounding factors.\nFor example, we discovered two clusters of food images, one driven by color,\nthe other by shape. We also uncover previously unreported areas such as regions\nof extrastriate body area (EBA) tuned for legs/hands and sensitivity to\nnumerosity in right intraparietal sulcus, and more. Thus, our\ncontrastive-learning methodology better characterizes new and existing\nvisuo-semantic representations in the brain by leveraging multimodal neural\nnetwork representations and a novel adaptation of clustering algorithms.",

        "abstract": "There is a rapidly growing interest in controlling consistency across\nmultiple generated images using diffusion models. Among various methods, recent\nworks have found that simply manipulating attention modules by concatenating\nfeatures from multiple reference images provides an efficient approach to\nenhancing consistency without fine-tuning. Despite its popularity and success,\nfew studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms that contribute to its\neffectiveness. In this work, we reveal that the popular approach is a linear\ninterpolation of image self-attention and cross-attention between synthesized\ncontent and reference features, with a constant rank-1 coefficient. Motivated\nby this observation, we find that a rank-1 coefficient is not necessary and\nsimplifies the controllable generation mechanism. The resulting algorithm,\nwhich we coin as RefDrop, allows users to control the influence of reference\ncontext in a direct and precise manner. Besides further enhancing consistency\nin single-subject image generation, our method also enables more interesting\napplications, such as the consistent generation of multiple subjects,\nsuppressing specific features to encourage more diverse content, and\nhigh-quality personalized video generation by boosting temporal consistency.\nEven compared with state-of-the-art image-prompt-based generators, such as\nIP-Adapter, RefDrop is competitive in terms of controllability and quality\nwhile avoiding the need to train a separate image encoder for feature injection\nfrom reference images, making it a versatile plug-and-play solution for any\nimage or video diffusion model.",

        "abstract": "High-performance Transformer trackers have shown excellent results, yet they\noften bear a heavy computational load. Observing that a smaller input can\nimmediately and conveniently reduce computations without changing the model, an\neasy solution is to adopt the low-resolution input for efficient Transformer\ntracking. Albeit faster, this hurts tracking accuracy much due to information\nloss in low resolution tracking. In this paper, we aim to mitigate such\ninformation loss to boost the performance of the low-resolution Transformer\ntracking via dual knowledge distillation from a frozen high-resolution (but not\na larger) Transformer tracker. The core lies in two simple yet effective\ndistillation modules, comprising query-key-value knowledge distillation\n(QKV-KD) and discrimination knowledge distillation (Disc-KD), across\nresolutions. The former, from the global view, allows the low-resolution\ntracker to inherit the features and interactions from the high-resolution\ntracker, while the later, from the target-aware view, enhances the\ntarget-background distinguishing capacity via imitating discriminative regions\nfrom its high-resolution counterpart. With the dual knowledge distillation, our\nLow-Resolution Transformer Tracker (LoReTrack) enjoys not only high efficiency\nowing to reduced computation but also enhanced accuracy by distilling knowledge\nfrom the high-resolution tracker. In extensive experiments, LoReTrack with a\n256x256 resolution consistently improves baseline with the same resolution, and\nshows competitive or even better results compared to 384x384 high-resolution\nTransformer tracker, while running 52% faster and saving 56% MACs. Moreover,\nLoReTrack is resolution-scalable. With a 128x128 resolution, it runs 25 fps on\na CPU with 64.9%/46.4% SUC scores on LaSOT/LaSOText, surpassing all other CPU\nreal-time trackers.

        "abstract": "Deep learning has been extensively applied in medical image reconstruction,\nwhere Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nrepresent the predominant paradigms, each possessing distinct advantages and\ninherent limitations: CNNs exhibit linear complexity with local sensitivity,\nwhereas ViTs demonstrate quadratic complexity with global sensitivity. The\nemerging Mamba has shown superiority in learning visual representation, which\ncombines the advantages of linear scalability and global sensitivity. In this\nstudy, we introduce MambaMIR, an Arbitrary-Masked Mamba-based model with\nwavelet decomposition for joint medical image reconstruction and uncertainty\nestimation. A novel Arbitrary Scan Masking (ASM) mechanism ``masks out''\nredundant information to introduce randomness for further uncertainty\nestimation. Compared to the commonly used Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, our\nproposed MC-ASM provides an uncertainty map without the need for hyperparameter\ntuning and mitigates the performance drop typically observed when applying\ndropout to low-level tasks. For further texture preservation and better\nperceptual quality, we employ the wavelet transformation into MambaMIR and\nexplore its variant based on the Generative Adversarial Network, namely\nMambaMIR-GAN. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted for multiple\nrepresentative medical image reconstruction tasks, demonstrating that the\nproposed MambaMIR and MambaMIR-GAN outperform other baseline and\nstate-of-the-art methods in different reconstruction tasks, where MambaMIR\nachieves the best reconstruction fidelity and MambaMIR-GAN has the best\nperceptual quality.

Recently, zero-shot QR has been a promising\napproach due to its ability to exploit knowledge inherent in large language\nmodels. Inspired by the success of ensemble prompting strategies which have\nbenefited other tasks, we investigate if they can improve query reformulation.\nIn this context, we propose two ensemble-based prompting techniques,\nGenQREnsemble and GenQRFusion which leverage paraphrases of a zero-shot\ninstruction to generate multiple sets of keywords to improve retrieval\nperformance ultimately. We further introduce their post-retrieval variants to\nincorporate relevance feedback from a variety of sources, including an oracle\nsimulating a human user and a \"critic\" LLM. We demonstrate that an ensemble of\nquery reformulations can improve retrieval effectiveness by up to 18% on\nnDCG@10 in pre-retrieval settings and 9% on post-retrieval settings on multiple\nbenchmarks, outperforming all previously reported SOTA results. We perform\nsubsequent analyses to investigate the effects of feedback documents,\nincorporate domain-specific instructions, filter reformulations, and generate\nfluent reformulations that might be more beneficial to human searchers.\nTogether, the techniques and the results presented in this paper establish a\nnew state of the art in automated query reformulation for retrieval and suggest\npromising directions for future research.",

It is well-established that these intrinsic driving behaviors\nsignificantly influence vehicle energy consumption. Therefore, establishing a\nquantitative relationship between driver behavior and energy usage is essential\nfor identifying energy-efficient driving practices and optimizing routes within\nurban traffic. This study introduces a data-driven approach to predict the\nequivalent fuel consumption of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) based\non an integrated model of driver behavior and vehicle energy consumption.\nUnlike traditional models that provide point predictions of fuel consumption,\nthis approach uses Conformalized Quantile Regression (CQR) to offer prediction\nintervals that capture the variability and uncertainty in fuel consumption.\nThese intervals reflect changes in fuel consumption, as well as variations in\ndriver behavior, and vehicle and route conditions. To develop this model,\ndriver-specific data were collected through a driver-in-the-loop simulator,\nwhich tested different human drivers responses. The CQR model was then trained\nand validated using the experimental data from the driver-in-the-loop\nsimulator, augmented by the synthetic data generated from Monte Carlo\nsimulations conducted using a calibrated microscopic driver behavior and\nvehicle energy model. The CQR model was evaluated by comparing its predictions\nof equivalent fuel consumption intervals with those of baseline prediction\ninterval methods that rely solely on conformal prediction.",

        "abstract": "Natural disasters can have catastrophic consequences, a poignant example is\nthe series of $7.7$ and $7.6$ magnitude earthquakes that devastated T\\\"urkiye\non February 6, 2023. To limit the damage, it is essential to maintain the\ncommunications infrastructure to ensure individuals impacted by the disaster\ncan receive critical information. The disastrous earthquakes in T\\\"urkiye have\nrevealed the importance of considering communications and energy solutions\ntogether to build resilient and sustainable infrastructure. Thus, this paper\nproposes an integrated space-air-ground-sea network architecture that utilizes\nvarious communications and energy-enabling technologies. This study aims to\ncontribute to the development of robust and sustainable disaster-response\nframeworks. In light of the T\\\"urkiye earthquakes, two methods for network\nmanagement are proposed: the first aims to ensure sustainability in the\npre-disaster phase and the second aims to maintain communications during the\nin-disaster phase. In these frameworks, communications technologies such as\nHigh Altitude Platform Station(s)(HAPS), which are among the key enablers to\nunlock the potential of 6G networks, and energy technologies such as Renewable\nEnergy Sources (RES), Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs), and Electric\nVehicles (EVs) have been used as the prominent technologies. By simulating a\ncase study, we demonstrate the performance of a proposed framework for\nproviding network resiliency. The paper concludes with potential challenges and\nfuture directions to achieve a disaster-resilient network architecture\nsolution.",

        "abstract": "Empathy serves as a cornerstone in enabling prosocial behaviors, and can be\nevoked through sharing of personal experiences in stories. While empathy is\ninfluenced by narrative content, intuitively, people respond to the way a story\nis told as well, through narrative style. Yet the relationship between empathy\nand narrative style is not fully understood. In this work, we empirically\nexamine and quantify this relationship between style and empathy using LLMs and\nlarge-scale crowdsourcing studies. We introduce a novel, theory-based taxonomy,\nHEART (Human Empathy and Narrative Taxonomy) that delineates elements of\nnarrative style that can lead to empathy with the narrator of a story. We\nestablish the performance of LLMs in extracting narrative elements from HEART,\nshowing that prompting with our taxonomy leads to reasonable, human-level\nannotations beyond what prior lexicon-based methods can do. To show empirical\nuse of our taxonomy, we collect a dataset of empathy judgments of stories via a\nlarge-scale crowdsourcing study with N=2,624 participants. We show that\nnarrative elements extracted via LLMs, in particular, vividness of emotions and\nplot volume, can elucidate the pathways by which narrative style cultivates\nempathy towards personal stories. Our work suggests that such models can be\nused for narrative analyses that lead to human-centered social and behavioral\ninsights.",

Moreover, BioDiscoveryAgent achieves an average of 18% improvement in\ndetecting desired phenotypes across five datasets, compared to existing\nBayesian optimization baselines specifically trained for this task. Our\nevaluation includes one dataset that is unpublished, ensuring it is not part of\nthe language model's training data. Additionally, BioDiscoveryAgent predicts\ngene combinations to perturb twice as accurately as a random baseline, a task\nso far not explored in the context of closed-loop experiment design. The agent\nalso has access to tools for searching the biomedical literature, executing\ncode to analyze biological datasets, and prompting another agent to critically\nevaluate its predictions.

When the MDP has an\ninfinite horizon, the optimal VFs and policies are stationary under mild\nconditions. However, in finite-horizon MDPs, the VFs (hence, the policies) vary\nwith time. This poses a challenge since the number of VFs to estimate grows not\nonly with the size of the state-action space but also with the time horizon.\nThis paper proposes a non-parametric low-rank stochastic algorithm to\napproximate the VFs of finite-horizon MDPs. First, we represent the (unknown)\nVFs as a multi-dimensional array, or tensor, where time is one of the\ndimensions. Then, we use rewards sampled from the MDP to estimate the optimal\nVFs. More precisely, we use the (truncated) PARAFAC decomposition to design an\nonline low-rank algorithm that recovers the entries of the tensor of VFs. The\nsize of the low-rank PARAFAC model grows additively with respect to each of its\ndimensions, rendering our approach efficient, as demonstrated via numerical\nexperiments.",

Specifically, we utilize the influence\nfunction, a tool for estimating sample influence, to select newly added samples\nand assign their salutary labels by choosing the category that maximizes their\npositive influence. This process eliminates the need for human annotation.\nExtensive experiments conducted on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of our salutary labeling approach over traditional active\nlearning strategies.

We contribute to resolving this need by\npresenting the first large-scale synthetic dataset of 3D made-to-measure\ngarments with sewing patterns, as well as its generation pipeline.\nGarmentCodeData contains 115,000 data points that cover a variety of designs in\nmany common garment categories: tops, shirts, dresses, jumpsuits, skirts,\npants, etc., fitted to a variety of body shapes sampled from a custom\nstatistical body model based on CAESAR, as well as a standard reference body\nshape, applying three different textile materials. To enable the creation of\ndatasets of such complexity, we introduce a set of algorithms for automatically\ntaking tailor's measures on sampled body shapes, sampling strategies for sewing\npattern design, and propose an automatic, open-source 3D garment draping\npipeline based on a fast XPBD simulator, while contributing several solutions\nfor collision resolution and drape correctness to enable scalability.\n  Dataset: http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/673889",

        "abstract": "Popularity bias in music recommendation systems -- where artists and tracks\nwith the highest listen counts are recommended more often -- can also propagate\nbiases along demographic and cultural axes. In this work, we identify these\nbiases in recommendations for artists from underrepresented cultural groups in\nprototype-based matrix factorization methods. Unlike traditional matrix\nfactorization methods, prototype-based approaches are interpretable. This\nallows us to directly link the observed bias in recommendations for minority\nartists (the effect) to specific properties of the embedding space (the cause).\nWe mitigate popularity bias in music recommendation through capturing both\nusers' and songs' cultural nuances in the embedding space. To address these\nchallenges while maintaining recommendation quality, we propose two novel\nenhancements to the embedding space: i) we propose an approach to filter-out\nthe irrelevant prototypes used to represent each user and item to improve\ngeneralizability, and ii) we introduce regularization techniques to reinforce a\nmore uniform distribution of prototypes within the embedding space. Our results\ndemonstrate significant improvements in reducing popularity bias and enhancing\ndemographic and cultural fairness in music recommendations while achieving\ncompetitive -- if not better -- overall performance.",

To tackle these\nissues, Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is employed as an effective\nstrategy to enhance the available knowledge base and anchor the responses in\nreality by pulling additional texts from external databases. In real-world\napplications, texts are often linked through entities within a graph, such as\ncitations in academic papers or comments in social networks. This paper\nexploits these topological relationships to guide the retrieval process in RAG.\nSpecifically, we explore two kinds of topological connections: proximity-based,\nfocusing on closely connected nodes, and role-based, which looks at nodes\nsharing similar subgraph structures. Our empirical research confirms their\nrelevance to text relationships, leading us to develop a Topology-aware\nRetrieval-augmented Generation framework. This framework includes a retrieval\nmodule that selects texts based on their topological relationships and an\naggregation module that integrates these texts into prompts to stimulate LLMs\nfor text generation.

        "abstract": "3D open-vocabulary scene understanding, crucial for advancing augmented\nreality and robotic applications, involves interpreting and locating specific\nregions within a 3D space as directed by natural language instructions. To this\nend, we introduce GOI, a framework that integrates semantic features from 2D\nvision-language foundation models into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and\nidentifies 3D Gaussians of Interest using an Optimizable Semantic-space\nHyperplane. Our approach includes an efficient compression method that utilizes\nscene priors to condense noisy high-dimensional semantic features into compact\nlow-dimensional vectors, which are subsequently embedded in 3DGS. During the\nopen-vocabulary querying process, we adopt a distinct approach compared to\nexisting methods, which depend on a manually set fixed empirical threshold to\nselect regions based on their semantic feature distance to the query text\nembedding. This traditional approach often lacks universal accuracy, leading to\nchallenges in precisely identifying specific target areas. Instead, our method\ntreats the feature selection process as a hyperplane division within the\nfeature space, retaining only those features that are highly relevant to the\nquery. We leverage off-the-shelf 2D Referring Expression Segmentation (RES)\nmodels to fine-tune the semantic-space hyperplane, enabling a more precise\ndistinction between target regions and others. This fine-tuning substantially\nimproves the accuracy of open-vocabulary queries, ensuring the precise\nlocalization of pertinent 3D Gaussians.

Prior work\nhas optimized the layout of individual, non-recursive structures without\nconsidering how collections of those objects in linked or recursive data\nstructures are laid out. This work introduces Marmoset, a compiler that\noptimizes the layouts of algebraic datatypes, with a special focus on producing\nhighly optimized, packed data layouts where recursive structures can be\ntraversed with minimal pointer chasing. Marmoset performs an analysis of how a\nrecursive ADT is used across functions to choose a global layout that promotes\nsimple, strided access for that ADT in memory. It does so by building and\nsolving a constraint system to minimize an abstract cost model, yielding a\npredicted efficient layout for the ADT. Marmoset then builds on top of Gibbon,\na prior compiler for packed, mostly-serial representations, to synthesize\noptimized ADTs. We show experimentally that Marmoset is able to choose optimal\nlayouts across a series of microbenchmarks and case studies, outperforming both\nGibbons baseline approach, as well as MLton, a Standard ML compiler that uses\ntraditional pointer-heavy representations.",

We provide a surprisingly simple\nunyfing formula for the evolution of the learned matrix that contains as\nspecial cases both lazy and balanced regimes but also a mixed regime in between\nthe two. In the mixed regime, a part of the network is lazy while the other is\nbalanced. More precisely the network is lazy along singular values that are\nbelow a certain threshold and balanced along those that are above the same\nthreshold. At initialization, all singular values are lazy, allowing for the\nnetwork to align itself with the task, so that later in time, when some of the\nsingular value cross the threshold and become active they will converge rapidly\n(convergence in the balanced regime is notoriously difficult in the absence of\nalignment). The mixed regime is the `best of both worlds': it converges from\nany random initialization (in contrast to balanced dynamics which require\nspecial initialization), and has a low rank bias (absent in the lazy dynamics).\nThis allows us to prove an almost complete phase diagram of training behavior\nas a function of the variance at initialization and the width, for a MSE\ntraining task.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the dynamics of asymmetrical bounding gaits in\nquadrupedal robots, focusing on the integration of torso pitching and hip\nmotion to enhance speed and stability. Traditional control strategies often\nenforce a fixed posture, minimizing natural body movements to simplify the\ncontrol problem. However, this approach may overlook the inherent dynamical\nadvantages found in natural locomotion. By considering the robot as two\ninterconnected segments, we concentrate on stance leg motion while allowing\npassive torso oscillation, drawing inspiration from natural dynamics and\nunderactuated robotics principles. Our control scheme employs Linear Inverted\nPendulum (LIP) and Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) models to govern\nfront and rear leg movements independently. This approach has been validated\nthrough extensive simulations and hardware experiments, demonstrating\nsuccessful high-speed locomotion with top speeds nearing 4 m/s and reduced\nground reaction forces, indicating a more efficient gait. Furthermore, unlike\nconventional methods, our strategy leverages natural torso oscillations to aid\nleg circulation and stride length, aligning robot dynamics more closely with\nbiological counterparts. Our findings suggest that embracing the natural\ndynamics of quadrupedal movement, particularly in asymmetrical gaits like\nbounding, can lead to more stable, efficient, and high-speed robotic\nlocomotion.

In this work, we propose the application of Concept Bottleneck Models\n(CBMs), a family of inherently interpretable neural network architectures based\non concept explanations, to the task of RUL prediction. Unlike attribution\nmethods, which explain decisions in terms of low-level input features, concepts\nrepresent high-level information that is easily understandable by users.\nMoreover, once verified in actual applications, CBMs enable domain experts to\nintervene on the concept activations at test-time. We propose using the\ndifferent degradation modes of an asset as intermediate concepts. Our case\nstudies on the New Commercial Modular AeroPropulsion System Simulation\n(N-CMAPSS) aircraft engine dataset for RUL prediction demonstrate that the\nperformance of CBMs can be on par or superior to black-box models, while being\nmore interpretable, even when the available labeled concepts are limited.

The Bayesian renormalization group (BRG) is an information-theoretic\ncoarse graining scheme that generalizes the principles of the Exact\nRenormalization Group (ERG) to arbitrarily parameterized probability\ndistributions, including those of NNs. In BRG, coarse graining is performed in\nparameter space with respect to an information-theoretic distinguishability\nscale set by the Fisher information metric. In this paper, we unify NNFT and\nBRG to form a powerful new framework for exploring the space of NNs and SFTs,\nwhich we coin BRG-NNFT. With BRG-NNFT, NN training dynamics can be interpreted\nas inducing a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `IR'\n$\\rightarrow$ `UV'. Conversely, applying an information-shell coarse graining\nto the trained network's parameters induces a flow in the space of SFTs from\nthe information-theoretic `UV' $\\rightarrow$ `IR'. When the\ninformation-theoretic cutoff scale coincides with a standard momentum scale,\nBRG is equivalent to ERG. We demonstrate the BRG-NNFT correspondence on two\nanalytically tractable examples. First, we construct BRG flows for trained,\ninfinite-width NNs, of arbitrary depth, with generic activation functions. As a\nspecial case, we then restrict to architectures with a single infinitely-wide\nlayer, scalar outputs, and generalized cos-net activations. In this case, we\nshow that BRG coarse-graining corresponds exactly to the momentum-shell ERG\nflow of a free scalar SFT.

        "abstract": "Decision support systems based on prediction sets have proven to be effective\nat helping human experts solve classification tasks. Rather than providing\nsingle-label predictions, these systems provide sets of label predictions\nconstructed using conformal prediction, namely prediction sets, and ask human\nexperts to predict label values from these sets. In this paper, we first show\nthat the prediction sets constructed using conformal prediction are, in\ngeneral, suboptimal in terms of average accuracy. Then, we show that the\nproblem of finding the optimal prediction sets under which the human experts\nachieve the highest average accuracy is NP-hard. More strongly, unless P = NP,\nwe show that the problem is hard to approximate to any factor less than the\nsize of the label set. However, we introduce a simple and efficient greedy\nalgorithm that, for a large class of expert models and non-conformity scores,\nis guaranteed to find prediction sets that provably offer equal or greater\nperformance than those constructed using conformal prediction. Further, using a\nsimulation study with both synthetic and real expert predictions, we\ndemonstrate that, in practice, our greedy algorithm finds near-optimal\nprediction sets offering greater performance than conformal prediction.",

These models first embed images into a fixed large\nnumber of visual tokens and then feed them into a Large Language Model (LLM).\nHowever, this design causes an excessive number of tokens for dense visual\nscenarios such as high-resolution images and videos, leading to great\ninefficiency. While token pruning/merging methods do exist, they produce a\nsingle length output for each image and do not afford flexibility in trading\noff information density v.s. efficiency. Inspired by the concept of Matryoshka\nDolls, we propose M3: Matryoshka Multimodal Models, which learns to represent\nvisual content as nested sets of visual tokens that capture information across\nmultiple coarse-to-fine granularities. Our approach offers several unique\nbenefits for LMMs: (1) One can explicitly control the visual granularity per\ntest instance during inference, e.g. , adjusting the number of tokens used to\nrepresent an image based on the anticipated complexity or simplicity of the\ncontent; (2) M3 provides a framework for analyzing the granularity needed for\nexisting datasets, where we find that COCO-style benchmarks only need around ~9\nvisual tokens to obtain accuracy similar to that of using all 576 tokens; (3)\nOur approach provides a foundation to explore the best trade-off between\nperformance and visual token length at sample level, where our investigation\nreveals that a large gap exists between the oracle upper bound and current\nfixed-scale representations.",

Most existing methods employ dense grids\nsuch as voxels as scene representations, which ignore the sparsity of occupancy\nand the diversity of object scales and thus lead to unbalanced allocation of\nresources. To address this, we propose an object-centric representation to\ndescribe 3D scenes with sparse 3D semantic Gaussians where each Gaussian\nrepresents a flexible region of interest and its semantic features. We\naggregate information from images through the attention mechanism and\niteratively refine the properties of 3D Gaussians including position,\ncovariance, and semantics.

        "abstract": "Robot manipulation policies have shown unsatisfactory action performance when\nconfronted with novel task or object instances. Hence, the capability to\nautomatically detect and self-correct failure action is essential for a\npractical robotic system. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\nhave shown promise in visual instruction following and demonstrated strong\nreasoning abilities in various tasks. To unleash general MLLMs as an end-to-end\nrobotic agent, we introduce a Self-Corrected (SC)-MLLM, equipping our model not\nonly to predict end-effector poses but also to autonomously recognize and\ncorrect failure actions. Specifically, we first conduct parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning to empower MLLM with pose prediction ability, which is reframed as\na language modeling problem. When facing execution failures, our model learns\nto identify low-level action error causes (i.e., position and rotation errors)\nand adaptively seeks prompt feedback from experts. Based on the feedback,\nSC-MLLM rethinks the current failure scene and generates the corrected actions.\nFurthermore, we design a continuous policy learning method for successfully\ncorrected samples, enhancing the model's adaptability to the current scene\nconfiguration and reducing the frequency of expert intervention. To evaluate\nour SC-MLLM, we conduct extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world\nsettings. SC-MLLM agent significantly improve manipulation accuracy compared to\nprevious state-of-the-art robotic MLLM (ManipLLM), increasing from 57\\% to 79\\%\non seen object categories and from 47\\% to 69\\% on unseen novel categories.",

        "abstract": "$Q$-learning algorithms are appealing for real-world applications due to\ntheir data-efficiency, but they are very prone to overfitting and training\ninstabilities when trained from visual observations. Prior work, namely SVEA,\nfinds that selective application of data augmentation can improve the visual\ngeneralization of RL agents without destabilizing training. We revisit its\nrecipe for data augmentation, and find an assumption that limits its\neffectiveness to augmentations of a photometric nature. Addressing these\nlimitations, we propose a generalized recipe, SADA, that works with wider\nvarieties of augmentations. We benchmark its effectiveness on DMC-GB2 -- our\nproposed extension of the popular DMControl Generalization Benchmark -- as well\nas tasks from Meta-World and the Distracting Control Suite, and find that our\nmethod, SADA, greatly improves training stability and generalization of RL\nagents across a diverse set of augmentations.

        "abstract": "Many online hate groups exist to disparage others based on race, gender\nidentity, sex, or other characteristics. The accessibility of these communities\nallows users to join multiple types of hate groups (e.g., a racist community\nand misogynistic community), which calls into question whether these\nperipatetic users could be further radicalized compared to users that stay in\none type of hate group. However, little is known about the dynamics of joining\nmultiple types of hate groups, nor the effect of these groups on peripatetic\nusers. In this paper, we develop a new method to classify hate subreddits, and\nthe identities they disparage, which we use to better understand how users\nbecome peripatetic (join different types of hate subreddits). The hate\nclassification technique utilizes human-validated LLMs to extract the protected\nidentities attacked, if any, across 168 subreddits. We then cluster\nidentity-attacking subreddits to discover three broad categories of hate:\nracist, anti-LGBTQ, and misogynistic. We show that becoming active in a user's\nfirst hate subreddit can cause them to become active in additional hate\nsubreddits of a different category. We also find that users who join additional\nhate subreddits, especially of a different category, become more active in hate\nsubreddits as a whole and develop a wider hate group lexicon. We are therefore\nmotivated to train an AI model that we find usefully predicts the hate\ncategories users will become active in based on post text read and written. The\naccuracy of this model may be partly driven by peripatetic users often using\nthe language of hate subreddits they eventually join. Overall, these results\nhighlight the unique risks associated with hate communities on a social media\nplatform, as discussion of alternative targets of hate may lead users to target\nmore protected identities.",

        "abstract": "We propose Reference-Based Modulation (RB-Modulation), a new plug-and-play\nsolution for training-free personalization of diffusion models. Existing\ntraining-free approaches exhibit difficulties in (a) style extraction from\nreference images in the absence of additional style or content text\ndescriptions, (b) unwanted content leakage from reference style images, and (c)\neffective composition of style and content. RB-Modulation is built on a novel\nstochastic optimal controller where a style descriptor encodes the desired\nattributes through a terminal cost. The resulting drift not only overcomes the\ndifficulties above, but also ensures high fidelity to the reference style and\nadheres to the given text prompt. We also introduce a cross-attention-based\nfeature aggregation scheme that allows RB-Modulation to decouple content and\nstyle from the reference image. With theoretical justification and empirical\nevidence, our framework demonstrates precise extraction and control of content\nand style in a training-free manner. Further, our method allows a seamless\ncomposition of content and style, which marks a departure from the dependency\non external adapters or ControlNets.",

        "abstract": "Product attribute extraction is an growing field in e-commerce business, with\nseveral applications including product ranking, product recommendation, future\nassortment planning and improving online shopping customer experiences.\nUnderstanding the customer needs is critical part of online business,\nspecifically fashion products. Retailers uses assortment planning to determine\nthe mix of products to offer in each store and channel, stay responsive to\nmarket dynamics and to manage inventory and catalogs. The goal is to offer the\nright styles, in the right sizes and colors, through the right channels. When\nshoppers find products that meet their needs and desires, they are more likely\nto return for future purchases, fostering customer loyalty. Product attributes\nare a key factor in assortment planning. In this paper we present PAE, a\nproduct attribute extraction algorithm for future trend reports consisting text\nand images in PDF format. Most existing methods focus on attribute extraction\nfrom titles or product descriptions or utilize visual information from existing\nproduct images. Compared to the prior works, our work focuses on attribute\nextraction from PDF files where upcoming fashion trends are explained. This\nwork proposes a more comprehensive framework that fully utilizes the different\nmodalities for attribute extraction and help retailers to plan the assortment\nin advance. Our contributions are three-fold: (a) We develop PAE, an efficient\nframework to extract attributes from unstructured data (text and images); (b)\nWe provide catalog matching methodology based on BERT representations to\ndiscover the existing attributes using upcoming attribute values; (c) We\nconduct extensive experiments with several baselines and show that PAE is an\neffective, flexible and on par or superior (avg 92.5% F1-Score) framework to\nexisting state-of-the-art for attribute value extraction task.",

        "abstract": "Recent text-to-image customization works have been proven successful in\ngenerating images of given concepts by fine-tuning the diffusion models on a\nfew examples. However, these methods tend to overfit the concepts, resulting in\nfailure to create the concept under multiple conditions (e.g. headphone is\nmissing when generating a <sks> dog wearing a headphone'). Interestingly, we\nnotice that the base model before fine-tuning exhibits the capability to\ncompose the base concept with other elements (e.g. a dog wearing a headphone)\nimplying that the compositional ability only disappears after personalization\ntuning. Inspired by this observation, we present ClassDiffusion, a simple\ntechnique that leverages a semantic preservation loss to explicitly regulate\nthe concept space when learning the new concept. Despite its simplicity, this\nhelps avoid semantic drift when fine-tuning on the target concepts. Extensive\nqualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the use of semantic\npreservation loss effectively improves the compositional abilities of the\nfine-tune models. In response to the ineffective evaluation of CLIP-T metrics,\nwe introduce BLIP2-T metric, a more equitable and effective evaluation metric\nfor this particular domain. We also provide in-depth empirical study and\ntheoretical analysis to better understand the role of the proposed loss.\nLastly, we also extend our ClassDiffusion to personalized video generation,\ndemonstrating its flexibility.",

Nevertheless, existing driving\nworld models still have limitations in generalization to unseen environments,\nprediction fidelity of critical details, and action controllability for\nflexible application. In this paper, we present Vista, a generalizable driving\nworld model with high fidelity and versatile controllability. Based on a\nsystematic diagnosis of existing methods, we introduce several key ingredients\nto address these limitations. To accurately predict real-world dynamics at high\nresolution, we propose two novel losses to promote the learning of moving\ninstances and structural information. We also devise an effective latent\nreplacement approach to inject historical frames as priors for coherent\nlong-horizon rollouts. For action controllability, we incorporate a versatile\nset of controls from high-level intentions (command, goal point) to low-level\nmaneuvers (trajectory, angle, and speed) through an efficient learning\nstrategy. After large-scale training, the capabilities of Vista can seamlessly\ngeneralize to different scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets\nshow that Vista outperforms the most advanced general-purpose video generator\nin over 70% of comparisons and surpasses the best-performing driving world\nmodel by 55% in FID and 27% in FVD. Moreover, for the first time, we utilize\nthe capacity of Vista itself to establish a generalizable reward for real-world\naction evaluation without accessing the ground truth actions.",

        "abstract": "Understanding human behavior fundamentally relies on accurate 3D human pose\nestimation. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently shown promising\nadvancements, delivering state-of-the-art performance with rather lightweight\narchitectures. In the context of graph-structured data, leveraging the\neigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix for positional encoding is\neffective. Yet, the approach does not specify how to handle scenarios where\nedges in the input graph are missing. To this end, we propose a novel\npositional encoding technique, PerturbPE, that extracts consistent and regular\ncomponents from the eigenbasis. Our method involves applying multiple\nperturbations and taking their average to extract the consistent and regular\ncomponent from the eigenbasis. PerturbPE leverages the Rayleigh-Schrodinger\nPerturbation Theorem (RSPT) for calculating the perturbed eigenvectors.\nEmploying this labeling technique enhances the robustness and generalizability\nof the model. Our results support our theoretical findings, e.g. our\nexperimental analysis observed a performance enhancement of up to $12\\%$ on the\nHuman3.6M dataset in instances where occlusion resulted in the absence of one\nedge. Furthermore, our novel approach significantly enhances performance in\nscenarios where two edges are missing, setting a new benchmark for\nstate-of-the-art.",

However, detecting LGTs is challenging due to\nthe vast number of LLMs, making it impractical to account for each LLM\nindividually; hence, it is crucial to identify the common characteristics\nshared by these models. In this paper, we draw attention to a common feature of\nrecent powerful LLMs, namely the alignment training, i.e., training LLMs to\ngenerate human-preferable texts. Our key finding is that as these aligned LLMs\nare trained to maximize the human preferences, they generate texts with higher\nestimated preferences even than human-written texts; thus, such texts are\neasily detected by using the reward model (i.e., an LLM trained to model human\npreference distribution). Based on this finding, we propose two training\nschemes to further improve the detection ability of the reward model, namely\n(i) continual preference fine-tuning to make the reward model prefer aligned\nLGTs even further and (ii) reward modeling of Human/LLM mixed texts (a\nrephrased texts from human-written texts using aligned LLMs), which serves as a\nmedian preference text corpus between LGTs and human-written texts to learn the\ndecision boundary better. We provide an extensive evaluation by considering six\ntext domains across twelve aligned LLMs, where our method demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art results.

        "abstract": "We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation\nthat maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under\nfixed memory consumption. Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations\n(cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their\ntheoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be\neffectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to\ncompute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention\ncalculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention\ncomputation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for\ninter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention\ncalculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward\nand backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance\naccuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new\narchitecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous\ntesting on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and\nsequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In\naddition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with\nstate-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Federated learning has been widely\nused as an effective decentralized technique that collaboratively learns a\nshared prediction model while keeping the data local on different clients.\nUnfortunately, client devices often feature limited computation and\ncommunication resources leading to practical difficulties for large models. In\naddition, the heterogeneity that characterizes edge devices makes it\nsub-optimal to generate a single model that fits all of them. Differently from\nthe recent literature, where multiple models with different architectures are\nused, in this work, we propose using dynamical architectures which, employing\nearly-exit solutions, can adapt their processing (i.e. traversed layers)\ndepending on the input and on the operation conditions. This solution falls in\nthe realm of partial training methods and brings two benefits: a single model\nis used on a variety of devices; federating the models after local training is\nstraightforward.

We aim to\nmeasure the risks in finetuning LLMs through navigating the LLM safety\nlandscape. We discover a new phenomenon observed universally in the model\nparameter space of popular open-source LLMs, termed as \"safety basin\": randomly\nperturbing model weights maintains the safety level of the original aligned\nmodel in its local neighborhood. Our discovery inspires us to propose the new\nVISAGE safety metric that measures the safety in LLM finetuning by probing its\nsafety landscape. Visualizing the safety landscape of the aligned model enables\nus to understand how finetuning compromises safety by dragging the model away\nfrom the safety basin. LLM safety landscape also highlights the system prompt's\ncritical role in protecting a model, and that such protection transfers to its\nperturbed variants within the safety basin.

Existing\nleading simulators primarily use an encoder-decoder structure to encode the\nhistorical trajectories for future simulation.

To address these challenges,\nwe propose Behavior Generative Pre-trained Transformers (BehaviorGPT), a\ndecoder-only, autoregressive architecture designed to simulate the sequential\nmotion of multiple agents. Crucially, our approach discards the traditional\nseparation between \"history\" and \"future,\" treating each time step as the\n\"current\" one, resulting in a simpler, more parameter- and data-efficient\ndesign that scales seamlessly with data and computation. Additionally, we\nintroduce the Next-Patch Prediction Paradigm (NP3), which enables models to\nreason at the patch level of trajectories and capture long-range\nspatial-temporal interactions. BehaviorGPT ranks first across several metrics\non the Waymo Sim Agents Benchmark, demonstrating its exceptional performance in\nmulti-agent and agent-map interactions.

Utilizing CGRAs to accelerate the\nexecution of tight loops holds great potential for achieving significant\noverall performance gains, as a substantial portion of program execution time\nis dedicated to tight loops. But loop parallelization using CGRAs is\nchallenging because of loop-carried data dependencies. Traditionally,\nloop-carried dependencies are handled by spilling dependent values out of the\nreconfigurable array to a memory medium and then feeding them back to the grid.\nSpilling the values and feeding them back into the grid imposes additional\nlatencies and logic that impede performance and limit parallelism.\n  In this paper, we present the Dependency Resolved CGRA (DR-CGRA) architecture\nthat is designed to accelerate the execution of tight loops. DR-CGRA, which is\nbased on a massively-multithreaded CGRA, runs each iteration as a separate CGRA\nthread and maps loop-carried data dependencies to inter-thread communication\ninside the grid.

        "abstract": "Fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models is inherently a resource-intensive\ntask. While it can enhance the capabilities of the model, it also incurs\nsubstantial computational costs, posing challenges to the practical application\nof downstream tasks. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods\nsuch as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) rely on a bypass framework that ignores the\ndifferential parameter budget requirements across weight matrices, which may\nlead to suboptimal fine-tuning outcomes. To address this issue, we introduce\nthe Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) method. DoRA decomposes high-rank LoRA\nlayers into structured single-rank components, allowing for dynamic pruning of\nparameter budget based on their importance to specific tasks during training,\nwhich makes the most of the limited parameter budget. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that DoRA can achieve competitive performance compared with LoRA\nand full model fine-tuning, and outperform various strong baselines with the\nsame storage parameter budget.

Our model, Longitudinal Forecasting Model for\nAlzheimer's Disease (LongForMAD), harnesses the comprehensive temporal\ninformation embedded in sequences of patient visits that incorporate multimodal\ndata, providing a deeper understanding of disease progression than can be drawn\nfrom single-visit data alone. We present an empirical analysis across two\npatient groups-Cognitively Normal (CN) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)-over\na span of five follow-up years.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17351v1",
        "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting-based techniques have recently advanced 3D scene\nreconstruction and novel view synthesis, achieving high-quality real-time\nrendering. However, these approaches are inherently limited by the underlying\npinhole camera assumption in modeling the images and hence only work for\nAll-in-Focus (AiF) sharp image inputs. This severely affects their\napplicability in real-world scenarios where images often exhibit defocus blur\ndue to the limited depth-of-field (DOF) of imaging devices. Additionally,\nexisting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods also do not support rendering of\nDOF effects.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce DOF-GS that allows for rendering\nadjustable DOF effects, removing defocus blur as well as refocusing of 3D\nscenes, all from multi-view images degraded by defocus blur. To this end, we\nre-imagine the traditional Gaussian Splatting pipeline by employing a finite\naperture camera model coupled with explicit, differentiable defocus rendering\nguided by the Circle-of-Confusion (CoC). The proposed framework provides for\ndynamic adjustment of DOF effects by changing the aperture and focal distance\nof the underlying camera model on-demand. It also enables rendering varying DOF\neffects of 3D scenes post-optimization, and generating AiF images from\ndefocused training images. Furthermore, we devise a joint optimization strategy\nto further enhance details in the reconstructed scenes by jointly optimizing\nrendered defocused and AiF images. Our experimental results indicate that\nDOF-GS produces high-quality sharp all-in-focus renderings conditioned on\ninputs compromised by defocus blur, with the training process incurring only a\nmodest increase in GPU memory consumption. We further demonstrate the\napplications of the proposed method for adjustable defocus rendering and\nrefocusing of the 3D scene from input images degraded by defocus blur.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performances in\nvarious tasks. However, the performance of LLMs heavily depends on the input\nprompt, which has given rise to a number of recent works on prompt\noptimization. However, previous works often require the availability of a\nnumeric score to assess the quality of every prompt. Unfortunately, when a\nhuman user interacts with a black-box LLM, attaining such a score is often\ninfeasible and unreliable. Instead, it is usually significantly easier and more\nreliable to obtain preference feedback from a human user, i.e., showing the\nuser the responses generated from a pair of prompts and asking the user which\none is preferred. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of prompt\noptimization with human feedback (POHF), in which we aim to optimize the prompt\nfor a black-box LLM using only human preference feedback. Drawing inspiration\nfrom dueling bandits, we design a theoretically principled strategy to select a\npair of prompts to query for preference feedback in every iteration, and hence\nintroduce our algorithm named automated POHF (APOHF). We apply our APOHF\nalgorithm to various tasks, including optimizing user instructions, prompt\noptimization for text-to-image generative models, and response optimization\nwith human feedback (i.e., further refining the response using a variant of our\nAPOHF). The results demonstrate that our APOHF can efficiently find a good\nprompt using a small number of preference feedback instances. Our code can be\nfound at \\url{https://github.com/xqlin98/APOHF}.",

        "abstract": "As decarbonization agendas mature, macro-energy systems modelling studies\nhave increasingly focused on enhanced decision support methods that move beyond\nleast-cost modelling to improve consideration of additional objectives and\ntradeoffs. One candidate is Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA), which\nsystematically explores new objectives without explicit stakeholder\nelicitation. Previous literature lacks both a comprehensive review of MGA\nvector selection methods in large-scale energy system models and comparative\ntesting of their relative efficacies in this setting. To fill this gap, this\npaper provides a comprehensive review of the MGA literature, identifying at\nleast seven MGA vector selection methodologies and carrying out a systematic\nevaluation of four: Hop-Skip-Jump, Random Vector, Variable Min/Max, and\nModelling All Alternatives. We examine each method's runtime,\nparallelizability, new solution discovery efficiency, and spatial exploration\nin lower dimensional (N <= 100) spaces, as well as spatial exploration in a\nthree-zone, 8760-hour capacity expansion model case. Through these tests, we\nfind Random Vector provides the broadest exploration of the near-optimal\nfeasible region and Variable Min/Max provides the most extreme results, while\nthe two tie on computational speed. We thus propose a new Hybrid vector\nselection approach combining the two methods to take advantage of the strengths\nof each. Additional analysis is provided on MGA variable selection, in which we\ndemonstrate MGA problems formulated over generation variables fail to retain\ncost-optimal dispatch and are thus not reflective of real operations of\nequivalent hypothetical capacity choices. As such, we recommend future studies\nutilize a parallelized combined vector approach over the set of capacity\nvariables for best results in computational speed and spatial exploration while\nretaining optimal dispatch.",

Our model reflects users' diminishing interest in having\ntheir transactions added to the ledger over time, resulting in only a fraction\n$\\delta$ of the current demand persisting in the subsequent round. The\nframework presented by Lavi et al. [LSZ22], where users are impatient and\nderive utility only from immediate transaction inclusion in the next block,\ncorresponds to $\\delta=0$. Fully patient users who wait forever as in [Nis23],\ncorrespond to $\\delta=1$ in our model. This work provides new bounds on the\nprice dynamics for the more interesting case $\\delta\\in(0,1)$, showing somewhat\nunexpected effects on the dynamics itself. While the dynamics for the fully\npatient case is essentially \"oblivious\" of the structure of the daily demand\ncurve, this is no longer true for finite $\\delta < 1$. Moreover, the dynamics\nundergoes a \"transition phase\" where for some $\\delta$ it behaves as in the\nfully patient setting ($\\delta=1$), and for some smaller values\n$\\delta'<\\delta$ it stops \"oscillating\" and stays at the highest (\"monopolist\")\nprice. We provide quantitative bounds and analytical results that apply to\ndifferent demand functions showing that the bounds for $\\delta=1$ are not tight\nin general, for $\\delta<1$.

One\nsignificant obstacle in survival data generation is censoring, which manifests\nas not knowing the precise timing of observed (target) events for certain\ninstances. Existing methods face difficulties in accurately reproducing the\nreal distribution of event times for both observed (uncensored) events and\ncensored events, i.e., the generated event-time distributions do not accurately\nmatch the underlying distributions of the real data. So motivated, we propose a\nsimple paradigm to produce synthetic survival data by generating covariates\nconditioned on event times (and censoring indicators), thus allowing one to\nreuse existing conditional generative models for tabular data without\nsignificant computational overhead, and without making assumptions about the\n(usually unknown) generation mechanism underlying censoring.

        "abstract": "Sequential decision-making domains such as recommender systems, healthcare\nand education often have unobserved heterogeneity in the population that can be\nmodeled using latent bandits $-$ a framework where an unobserved latent state\ndetermines the model for a trajectory. While the latent bandit framework is\ncompelling, the extent of its generality is unclear. We first address this by\nestablishing a de Finetti theorem for decision processes, and show that\n$\\textit{every}$ exchangeable and coherent stateless decision process is a\nlatent bandit. The latent bandit framework lends itself particularly well to\nonline learning with offline datasets, a problem of growing interest in\nsequential decision-making. One can leverage offline latent bandit data to\nlearn a complex model for each latent state, so that an agent can simply learn\nthe latent state online to act optimally. We focus on a linear model for a\nlatent bandit with $d_A$-dimensional actions, where the latent states lie in an\nunknown $d_K$-dimensional subspace for $d_K \\ll d_A$. We present SOLD, a novel\nprincipled method to learn this subspace from short offline trajectories with\nguarantees. We then provide two methods to leverage this subspace online:\nLOCAL-UCB and ProBALL-UCB. We demonstrate that LOCAL-UCB enjoys $\\tilde\nO(\\min(d_A\\sqrt{T}, d_K\\sqrt{T}(1+\\sqrt{d_AT/d_KN})))$ regret guarantees, where\nthe effective dimension is lower when the size $N$ of the offline dataset is\nlarger. ProBALL-UCB enjoys a slightly weaker guarantee, but is more practical\nand computationally efficient. Finally, we establish the efficacy of our\nmethods using experiments on both synthetic data and real-life movie\nrecommendation data from MovieLens.",

As photometry is uninformative in regions\nunder low-illumination, we tackle the problem through a multi-sensor fusion\napproach, where we take as input an additional synchronized sparse point cloud\n(i.e., from a LiDAR) projected onto the image plane as a sparse depth map,\nalong with a camera image. The crux of our method lies in the use of the\nabundantly available synthetic data to first approximate the 3D scene structure\nby learning a mapping from sparse to (coarse) dense depth maps along with their\npredictive uncertainty - we term this, SpaDe. In poorly illuminated regions\nwhere photometric intensities do not afford the inference of local shape, the\ncoarse approximation of scene depth serves as a prior; the uncertainty map is\nthen used with the image to guide refinement through an uncertainty-driven\nresidual learning (URL) scheme. The resulting depth completion network\nleverages complementary strengths from both modalities - depth is sparse but\ninsensitive to illumination and in metric scale, and image is dense but\nsensitive with scale ambiguity. SpaDe can be used in a plug-and-play fashion,\nwhich allows for 25% improvement when augmented onto existing methods to\npreprocess sparse depth. We demonstrate URL on the nuScenes dataset where we\nimprove over all baselines by an average 11.65% in all-day scenarios, 11.23%\nwhen tested specifically for daytime, and 13.12% for nighttime scenes.",

The\ntask is to find a set $S$ of $k$ species that is viable in the food-web such\nthat the subtree of $T$ obtained by retaining only the vertices of $S$ has\ntotal edge weight at least $D$. Herein, viable means that for every predator\ntaxon of $S$, the set $S$ contains at least one prey taxon. We provide the\nfirst systematic analysis of PDD and its special case s-PDD from a\nparameterized complexity perspective. For solution-size related parameters, we\nshow that PDD is FPT with respect to $D$ and with respect to $k$ plus the\nheight of the phylogenetic tree. Moreover, we consider structural\nparameterizations of the food-web. For example, we show an FPT-algorithm for\nthe parameter that measures the vertex deletion distance to graphs where every\nconnected component is a complete graph. Finally, we show that s-PDD admits an\nFPT-algorithm for the treewidth of the food-web. This disproves a conjecture of\nFaller et al.

Methods based on physical simulation and motion\nprediction have achieved notable advances, but they are often limited to\nspecific object textures and motion trajectories, failing to exhibit highly\ncomplex environments and physical dynamics. In this paper, we introduce an\nopen-domain controllable image animation method using motion priors with video\ndiffusion models. Our method achieves precise control over the direction and\nspeed of motion in the movable region by extracting the motion field\ninformation from videos and learning moving trajectories and strengths.

Specifically, we decompose the denoise process\ninto two distinct phases: the shaping of scene contours and the refining of\nmotion details.

        "abstract": "The bridge arm of the hybrid modular multilevel converter (MMC) is composed\nof half-bridge and full-bridge sub-modules cascaded together. Compared with the\nhalf-bridge MMC, it can operate in the boost-AC mode, where the modulation\nindex can be higher than 1, and the DC voltage and the AC voltage level are no\nlonger mutually constrained; compared with the full-bridge MMC, it has lower\nswitching device costs and losses. When the hybrid MMC boost-AC mode is used in\nthe power electronic transformer, the degree of freedom in system design is\nimproved, and the cost and volume of the power electronic transformer system\ncan be further reduced. This paper analyzes how to make full use of the newly\nadded modulation index of freedom introduced by the boost-AC hybrid MMC to\noptimize the power electronic transformer system, and finally gives the optimal\nmodulation index selection scheme of the hybrid MMC for different optimization\nobjectives.",

However, human insights are often mere\nopinions and educated guesses rather than well-formulated arguments. While\nopinions are subject to uncertainty, e.g., due to partial informedness or\nignorance about a problem, they also emerge earlier than hard evidence could be\nproduced. Thus, guiding reinforcement learning agents through opinions offers\nthe potential for more performant learning processes, but comes with the\nchallenge of modeling and managing opinions in a formal way. In this article,\nwe present a method to guide reinforcement learning agents through opinions. To\nthis end, we provide an end-to-end method to model and manage advisors'\nopinions. To assess the utility of the approach, we evaluate it with synthetic\nand human advisors, at different levels of uncertainty, and under multiple\nadvise strategies. Our results indicate that opinions, even if uncertain,\nimprove the performance of reinforcement learning agents, resulting in higher\nrewards, more efficient exploration, and a better reinforced policy.

Such limitation motivates us to pose the problem\nof the time-aware personalized information diffusion prediction for the first\ntime, telling the time when the target user will be informed. In this paper, we\naddress this problem from a fresh geometric perspective of Ricci curvature, and\npropose a novel Ricci-curvature regulated Ordinary Differential Equation\n(R-ODE). In the diffusion process, R-ODE considers that the inter-correlated\nusers are organized in a dynamic system in the representation space, and the\ncascades give the observations sampled from the continuous realm. At each\ninfection time, the message diffuses along the largest Ricci curvature,\nsignifying less transportation effort. In the continuous realm, the message\ntriggers users' movement, whose trajectory in the space is parameterized by an\nODE with graph neural network. Consequently, R-ODE predicts the infection time\nof a target user by the movement trajectory learnt from the observations.\nExtensive experiments evaluate the personalized time prediction ability of\nR-ODE, and show R-ODE outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.",

Current assistive\nmobility platforms (e.g., robotic wheelchairs) often fail to incorporate user\npreferences and control, leading to reduced trust and efficiency. Existing\nshared control algorithms do not allow the incorporation of the user control\npreferences inside the navigation framework or the path planning algorithm. In\naddition, existing dynamic local planner algorithms for robotic wheelchairs do\nnot take into account the social spaces of people, potentially leading such\nplatforms to infringe upon these areas and cause discomfort. To address these\nconcerns, this work introduces a novel socially-aware shared autonomy-based\nnavigation system for assistive mobile robotic platforms.\n  Our navigation framework comprises a Global Planner and a Local Planner. To\nimplement the Global Planner, the proposed approach introduces a novel User\nPreference Field (UPF) theory within its global planning framework, explicitly\nacknowledging user preferences to adeptly navigate away from congested areas.\nFor the Local Planner, we propose a Socially-aware Shared Control-based Model\nPredictive Control with Dynamic Control Barrier Function (SS-MPC-DCBF) to\nadjust movements in real-time, integrating user preferences for safer, more\nautonomous navigation. Evaluation results show that our Global Planner aligns\nclosely with user preferences compared to baselines, and our Local Planner\ndemonstrates enhanced safety and efficiency in dynamic and static scenarios.\nThis integrated approach fosters trust and autonomy, crucial for the acceptance\nof assistive mobility technologies in the built environment.",

A novel calibration\npattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition\nalgorithm is proposed.

Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves\nthe most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close\naccuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and\naccurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate\ntoolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames.

While neural\nsolvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve\nthe PDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a specific set of PDEs,\ne.g. a certain equation or a finite set of coefficients. This bottleneck limits\nthe generalizability of neural solvers, which is widely recognized as its major\nadvantage over numerical solvers. In this paper, we present the Universal PDE\nsolver (Unisolver) capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs by leveraging a\nTransformer pre-trained on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs.\nInstead of simply scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the\ntheoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Our key finding is that a PDE\nsolution is fundamentally under the control of a series of PDE components, e.g.\nequation symbols, coefficients, and initial and boundary conditions. Inspired\nby the mathematical structure of PDEs, we define a complete set of PDE\ncomponents and correspondingly embed them as domain-wise (e.g. equation\nsymbols) and point-wise (e.g. boundaries) conditions for Transformer PDE\nsolvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances,\nUnisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art results on three challenging\nlarge-scale benchmarks, showing impressive gains and endowing favorable\ngeneralizability and scalability.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a popular privacy-preserving paradigm that enables\ndistributed clients to collaboratively train models with a central server while\nkeeping raw data locally. In practice, distinct model architectures, varying\ndata distributions, and limited resources across local clients inevitably cause\nmodel performance degradation and a slowdown in convergence speed. However,\nexisting FL methods can only solve some of the above heterogeneous challenges\nand have obvious performance limitations. Notably, a unified framework has not\nyet been explored to overcome these challenges. Accordingly, we propose FedHPL,\na parameter-efficient unified $\\textbf{Fed}$erated learning framework for\n$\\textbf{H}$eterogeneous settings based on $\\textbf{P}$rompt tuning and\n$\\textbf{L}$ogit distillation. Specifically, we employ a local prompt tuning\nscheme that leverages a few learnable visual prompts to efficiently fine-tune\nthe frozen pre-trained foundation model for downstream tasks, thereby\naccelerating training and improving model performance under limited local\nresources and data heterogeneity. Moreover, we design a global logit\ndistillation scheme to handle the model heterogeneity and guide the local\ntraining. In detail, we leverage logits to implicitly capture local knowledge\nand design a weighted knowledge aggregation mechanism to generate global\nclient-specific logits. We provide a theoretical guarantee on the\ngeneralization error bound for FedHPL.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on downstream\ntasks by in-context learning (ICL), which heavily relies on the quality of\ndemonstrations selected from a large set of annotated examples. Recent works\nclaim that in-context learning is robust to noisy demonstrations in text\nclassification. In this work, we show that, on text generation tasks, noisy\nannotations significantly hurt the performance of in-context learning. To\ncircumvent the issue, we propose a simple and effective approach called Local\nPerplexity Ranking (LPR), which replaces the \"noisy\" candidates with their\nnearest neighbors that are more likely to be clean. Our method is motivated by\nanalyzing the perplexity deviation caused by noisy labels and decomposing\nperplexity into inherent perplexity and matching perplexity. Our key idea\nbehind LPR is thus to decouple the matching perplexity by performing the\nranking among the neighbors in semantic space. Our approach can prevent the\nselected demonstrations from including mismatched input-label pairs while\npreserving the effectiveness of the original selection methods. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LPR, improving the EM score by up\nto 18.75 on common benchmarks with noisy annotations.",

        "abstract": "Remote sensing data provide a low-cost solution for large-scale monitoring of\nair pollution via the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD), but is often\nlimited by cloud contamination. Existing methods for AOD reconstruction rely on\ntemporal information. However, for remote sensing data at high spatial\nresolution, multi-temporal observations are often unavailable. In this letter,\nwe take advantage of deep representation learning from convolutional neural\nnetworks and propose Deep Feature Gaussian Processes (DFGP) for single-scene\nAOD reconstruction. By using deep learning, we transform the variables to a\nfeature space with better explainable power. By using Gaussian processes, we\nexplicitly consider the correlation between observed AOD and missing AOD in\nspatial and feature domains. Experiments on two AOD datasets with real-world\ncloud patterns showed that the proposed method outperformed deep CNN and random\nforest, achieving R$^2$ of 0.7431 on MODIS AOD and R$^2$ of 0.9211 on EMIT AOD,\ncompared to deep CNN's R$^2$ of 0.6507 and R$^2$ of 0.8619. The proposed\nmethods increased R$^2$ by over 0.35 compared to the popular random forest in\nAOD reconstruction.

        "abstract": "There is a prevalent opinion in the recent literature that Diffusion-based\nmodels outperform GAN-based counterparts on the Image Super Resolution (ISR)\nproblem. However, in most studies, Diffusion-based ISR models were trained\nlonger and utilized larger networks than the GAN baselines. This raises the\nquestion of whether the superiority of Diffusion models is due to the Diffusion\nparadigm being better suited for the ISR task or if it is a consequence of the\nincreased scale and computational resources used in contemporary studies. In\nour work, we compare Diffusion-based and GAN-based Super Resolution under\ncontrolled settings, where both approaches are matched in terms of\narchitecture, model and dataset size, and computational budget. We show that a\nGAN-based model can achieve results comparable to a Diffusion-based model.\nAdditionally, we explore the impact of design choices such as text conditioning\nand augmentation on the performance of ISR models, showcasing their effect on\nseveral downstream tasks.

We extend existing\nnumerical methods for this problem to a more complex setting involving varying\ngeometries of the domain to generate a challenging dataset. Further, we\ninvestigate three prominent neural PDE solver methods, namely the UNet, DRN and\nU-FNO, and extend them for characteristics of the oil-expulsion problem: (1)\nspatial conditioning on the geometry; (2) periodicity in the boundary; (3)\napproximate mass conservation. We scale all methods and benchmark their\nspeed-accuracy trade-off, evaluate qualitative properties, and perform an\nablation study. We find that the investigated methods can accurately model the\ndroplet dynamics with up to three orders of magnitude speed-up, that our\nextensions improve performance over the baselines, and that the introduced\nvarying geometries constitute a significantly more challenging setting over the\npreviously considered oil expulsion problem.",

        "abstract": "Low-rank adapters (LoRA) and their variants are popular parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT) techniques that closely match full model fine-tune\nperformance while requiring only a small number of additional parameters. These\nadditional LoRA parameters are specific to the base model being adapted. When\nthe base model needs to be deprecated and replaced with a new one, all the\nassociated LoRA modules need to be re-trained. Such re-training requires access\nto the data used to train the LoRA for the original base model. This is\nespecially problematic for commercial cloud applications where the LoRA modules\nand the base models are hosted by service providers who may not be allowed to\nhost proprietary client task data. To address this challenge, we propose\n$\\textit{Trans-LoRA}$ -- a novel method for lossless, nearly data-free transfer\nof LoRAs across base models. Our approach relies on synthetic data to transfer\nLoRA modules. Using large language models, we design a synthetic data generator\nto approximate the data-generating process of the $\\textit{observed}$ task data\nsubset. Training on the resulting synthetic dataset transfers LoRA modules to\nnew models. We show the effectiveness of our approach using both LLama and\nGemma model families.

In this paper, we\npropose TGNE (\\textbf{T}emporal \\textbf{G}aussian \\textbf{N}etwork\n\\textbf{E}mbedding), an innovative method that bridges two distinct strands of\nliterature: the statistical analysis of networks via Latent Space Models\n(LSM)\\cite{Hoff2002} and temporal graph machine learning.

The results demonstrate that TGNE generates competitive\ntime-varying embedding locations compared to common baselines for\nreconstructing unobserved edge interactions based on observed edges.\nFurthermore, the uncertainty estimates align with the time-varying degree\ndistribution in the network, providing valuable insights into the temporal\ndynamics of the graph.

        "abstract": "Generating novel views from a single image remains a challenging task due to\nthe complexity of 3D scenes and the limited diversity in the existing\nmulti-view datasets to train a model on. Recent research combining large-scale\ntext-to-image (T2I) models with monocular depth estimation (MDE) has shown\npromise in handling in-the-wild images. In these methods, an input view is\ngeometrically warped to novel views with estimated depth maps, then the warped\nimage is inpainted by T2I models. However, they struggle with noisy depth maps\nand loss of semantic details when warping an input view to novel viewpoints. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel approach for single-shot novel view synthesis, a\nsemantic-preserving generative warping framework that enables T2I generative\nmodels to learn where to warp and where to generate, through augmenting\ncross-view attention with self-attention. Our approach addresses the\nlimitations of existing methods by conditioning the generative model on source\nview images and incorporating geometric warping signals. Qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations demonstrate that our model outperforms existing\nmethods in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.

        "abstract": "Recently, we have witnessed the success of total variation (TV) for many\nimaging applications. However, traditional TV is defined on the original pixel\ndomain, which limits its potential. In this work, we suggest a new TV\nregularization defined on the neural domain. Concretely, the discrete data is\ncontinuously and implicitly represented by a deep neural network (DNN), and we\nuse the derivatives of DNN outputs w.r.t. input coordinates to capture local\ncorrelations of data. As compared with classical TV on the original domain, the\nproposed TV on the neural domain (termed NeurTV) enjoys two advantages. First,\nNeurTV is not limited to meshgrid but is suitable for both meshgrid and\nnon-meshgrid data. Second, NeurTV can more exactly capture local correlations\nacross data for any direction and any order of derivatives attributed to the\nimplicit and continuous nature of neural domain. We theoretically reinterpret\nNeurTV under the variational approximation framework, which allows us to build\nthe connection between classical TV and NeurTV and inspires us to develop\nvariants (e.g., NeurTV with arbitrary resolution and space-variant NeurTV).\nExtensive numerical experiments with meshgrid data (e.g., color and\nhyperspectral images) and non-meshgrid data (e.g., point clouds and spatial\ntranscriptomics) showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "The absence of real targets to guide the model training is one of the main\nproblems with the makeup transfer task. Most existing methods tackle this\nproblem by synthesizing pseudo ground truths (PGTs). However, the generated\nPGTs are often sub-optimal and their imprecision will eventually lead to\nperformance degradation. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel Content-Style Decoupled Makeup Transfer (CSD-MT) method, which works in a\npurely unsupervised manner and thus eliminates the negative effects of\ngenerating PGTs. Specifically, based on the frequency characteristics analysis,\nwe assume that the low-frequency (LF) component of a face image is more\nassociated with its makeup style information, while the high-frequency (HF)\ncomponent is more related to its content details. This assumption allows CSD-MT\nto decouple the content and makeup style information in each face image through\nthe frequency decomposition. After that, CSD-MT realizes makeup transfer by\nmaximizing the consistency of these two types of information between the\ntransferred result and input images, respectively. Two newly designed loss\nfunctions are also introduced to further improve the transfer performance.\nExtensive quantitative and qualitative analyses show the effectiveness of our\nCSD-MT method.

Optimization-based methods, such as\nmodel-predictive control, excel in finding optimal reaction forces and\nachieving agile locomotion, especially in quadruped, but struggle with the\nnonlinear hybrid dynamics of legged systems and the real-time computation of\nstep location, timing, and reaction forces. Conversely, RL-based methods show\npromise in navigating dynamic and rough terrains but are limited by their\nextensive data requirements.

The\npolicy efficiently learns high-level locomotion strategies, such as gait\nselection and step positioning, without the need for full dynamics simulations.\nThis control architecture enables humanoid robots to dynamically navigate\ndiscrete terrains, making strategic locomotion decisions (e.g., walking,\njumping, and leaping) based on ground height maps. Our results demonstrate that\nthis integrated control architecture achieves dynamic locomotion with\nsignificantly fewer training samples than conventional RL-based methods and can\nbe transferred to different humanoid platforms without additional training.

While traditional\nmethods rely on labor-intensive and time-consuming manual labeling, recent\napproaches employing models as automatic labelers have shown promising results\nwithout human intervention.

However, these neural networks often entail considerable\ntraining expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in\nmany scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new\nSpatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) that learns maps between Bochner\nspaces, and a new learning framework to address these issues. This new paradigm\nleverages wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques to refine\nthe pipeline of commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and\nevaluations. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow\nmodeling by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed architecture\ninitiates the training with a few epochs for SFNO, concluding with the freezing\nof most model parameters. Then, the last linear spectral convolution layer is\nfine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The optimization uses a negative\nSobolev norm for the first time as the loss in operator learning, defined\nthrough a reliable functional-type \\emph{a posteriori} error estimator whose\nevaluation is almost exact thanks to the Parseval identity. This design allows\nthe neural operators to effectively tackle low-frequency errors while the\nrelief of the de-aliasing filter addresses high-frequency errors.

        "abstract": "The introduction of geometry has proven instrumental in the efforts towards\nmore realistic models for real-world networks. In Geometric Inhomogeneous\nRandom Graphs (GIRGs), Euclidean Geometry induces clustering of the vertices,\nwhich is widely observed in networks in the wild. Euclidean Geometry in\nmultiple dimensions however restricts proximity of vertices to those cases\nwhere vertices are close in each coordinate. We introduce a large class of GIRG\nextensions, called BDF-GIRGs, which capture arbitrary hierarchies of the\ncoordinates within the distance function of the vertex feature space. These\ndistance functions have the potential to allow more realistic modeling of the\ncomplex formation of social ties in real-world networks, where similarities\nbetween people lead to connections. Here, similarity with respect to certain\nfeatures, such as familial kinship or a shared workplace, suffices for the\nformation of ties. It is known that - while many key properties of GIRGs, such\nas log-log average distance and sparsity, are independent of the distance\nfunction - the Euclidean metric induces small separators, i.e. sublinear cuts\nof the unique giant component in GIRGs, whereas no such sublinear separators\nexist under the component-wise minimum distance. Building on work of Lengler\nand Todorovi\\'{c}, we give a complete classification for the existence of small\nseparators in BDF-GIRGs. We further show that BDF-GIRGs all fulfill a\nstochastic triangle inequality and thus also exhibit clustering.",

We introduce an modified\nintegral expression for the solution to an elliptic equation in divergence form\nunder the Levi function framework. The well-posedness of the linear integral\nsystem with respect to the density functions to be determined is rigorously\nproved. Based on the singularity decomposition for the Levi function, we\npropose two schemes to deal with the volume integrals so that the density\nfunctions can be solved efficiently. One method is an adaptive discretization\nscheme (ADS) for computing the integrals with continuous integrands, leading to\nthe uniform accuracy of the integrals in the whole domain, and consequently the\nefficient computations for the density functions. The other method is the dual\nreciprocity method (DRM) which is a meshless approach converting the volume\nintegrals into boundary integrals equivalently by expressing the volume density\nas the combination of the radial basis functions determined by the interior\ngrids. The proposed schemes are justified numerically to be of satisfactory\ncomputation costs. Numerical examples in 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional cases\nare presented to show the validity of the proposed schemes.",

We introduce PromptEval, a method for estimating performance across a\nlarge set of prompts borrowing strength across prompts and examples to produce\naccurate estimates under practical evaluation budgets. The resulting\ndistribution can be used to obtain performance quantiles to construct various\nrobust performance metrics (e.g., top 95% quantile or median). We prove that\nPromptEval consistently estimates the performance distribution and demonstrate\nits efficacy empirically on three prominent LLM benchmarks: MMLU, BIG-bench\nHard, and LMentry. For example, PromptEval can accurately estimate performance\nquantiles across 100 prompt templates on MMLU with a budget equivalent to two\nsingle-prompt evaluations.

Additionally, we\ndemonstrate that the Dirichlet Energy, which reflects the smoothness of a\ngraph, can serve as coefficients for node representations across different\ndimensions of the spectral space. Building upon these observations and\nanalyses, we devise a novel anomaly measure for the NAD task.

However, the main bottleneck of existing\napproaches is the lack of supervision on the generator training, which often\nresults in undamped oscillation and unsatisfactory performance. To address this\nissue, we propose an algorithm called Monte Carlo GAN (MCGAN). This approach,\nutilizing an innovative generative loss function, termly the regression loss,\nreformulates the generator training as a regression task and enables the\ngenerator training by minimizing the mean squared error between the\ndiscriminator's output of real data and the expected discriminator of fake\ndata. We demonstrate the desirable analytic properties of the regression loss,\nincluding discriminability and optimality, and show that our method requires a\nweaker condition on the discriminator for effective generator training. These\nproperties justify the strength of this approach to improve the training\nstability while retaining the optimality of GAN by leveraging strong\nsupervision of the regression loss. Numerical results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed MCGAN significantly and consistently\nimproves the existing state-of-the-art GAN models in terms of quality,\naccuracy, training stability, and learned latent space.

        "abstract": "The vulnerability of neural network classifiers to adversarial attacks is a\nmajor obstacle to their deployment in safety-critical applications.\nRegularization of network parameters during training can be used to improve\nadversarial robustness and generalization performance. Usually, the network is\nregularized end-to-end, with parameters at all layers affected by\nregularization. However, in settings where learning representations is key,\nsuch as self-supervised learning (SSL), layers after the feature representation\nwill be discarded when performing inference. For these models, regularizing up\nto the feature space is more suitable. To this end, we propose a new spectral\nregularizer for representation learning that encourages black-box adversarial\nrobustness in downstream classification tasks. In supervised classification\nsettings, we show empirically that this method is more effective in boosting\ntest accuracy and robustness than previously-proposed methods that regularize\nall layers of the network. We then show that this method improves the\nadversarial robustness of classifiers using representations learned with\nself-supervised training or transferred from another classification task. In\nall, our work begins to unveil how representational structure affects\nadversarial robustness.",

We\nintroduce DreamMat, an innovative approach to resolve the aforementioned\nproblem, to generate high-quality PBR materials from text descriptions.

To tackle this problem, we first finetune a new light-aware 2D\ndiffusion model to condition on a given lighting environment and generate the\nshading results on this specific lighting condition. Then, by applying the same\nenvironment lights in the material distillation, DreamMat can generate\nhigh-quality PBR materials that are not only consistent with the given geometry\nbut also free from any baked-in shading effects in albedo.

Economic analysis is inherently complex, incorporating a\nmyriad of factors (such as macroeconomic indicators, political decisions). This\ncomplexity makes it challenging to fully account for all variables when\ndetermining the current state of the economy and predicting its future\ntrajectory in the upcoming months.

We compared three different machine learning approaches to classify\nthe phases of the business cycle, and among them, the Multinomial Logistic\nRegression (MLR) achieved the best results.

        "abstract": "The pre-trained point cloud model based on Masked Point Modeling (MPM) has\nexhibited substantial improvements across various tasks. However, these models\nheavily rely on the Transformer, leading to quadratic complexity and limited\ndecoder, hindering their practice application. To address this limitation, we\nfirst conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing Transformer-based MPM,\nemphasizing the idea that redundancy reduction is crucial for point cloud\nanalysis. To this end, we propose a Locally constrained Compact point cloud\nModel (LCM) consisting of a locally constrained compact encoder and a locally\nconstrained Mamba-based decoder. Our encoder replaces self-attention with our\nlocal aggregation layers to achieve an elegant balance between performance and\nefficiency. Considering the varying information density between masked and\nunmasked patches in the decoder inputs of MPM, we introduce a locally\nconstrained Mamba-based decoder. This decoder ensures linear complexity while\nmaximizing the perception of point cloud geometry information from unmasked\npatches with higher information density. Extensive experimental results show\nthat our compact model significantly surpasses existing Transformer-based\nmodels in both performance and efficiency, especially our LCM-based Point-MAE\nmodel, compared to the Transformer-based model, achieved an improvement of\n2.24%, 0.87%, and 0.94% in performance on the three variants of ScanObjectNN\nwhile reducing parameters by 88% and computation by 73%.",

        "abstract": "X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the most important diagnostic\nimaging techniques in clinical applications. Sparse-view CT imaging reduces the\nnumber of projection views to a lower radiation dose and alleviates the\npotential risk of radiation exposure. Most existing deep learning (DL) and deep\nunfolding sparse-view CT reconstruction methods: 1) do not fully use the\nprojection data; 2) do not always link their architecture designs to a\nmathematical theory; 3) do not flexibly deal with multi-sparse-view\nreconstruction assignments. This paper aims to use mathematical ideas and\ndesign optimal DL imaging algorithms for sparse-view tomography\nreconstructions. We propose a novel dual-domain deep unfolding unified\nframework that offers a great deal of flexibility for multi-sparse-view CT\nreconstruction with different sampling views through a single model. This\nframework combines the theoretical advantages of model-based methods with the\nsuperior reconstruction performance of DL-based methods, resulting in the\nexpected generalizability of DL. We propose a refinement module that utilizes\nunfolding projection domain to refine full-sparse-view projection errors, as\nwell as an image domain correction module that distills multi-scale geometric\nerror corrections to reconstruct sparse-view CT. This provides us with a new\nway to explore the potential of projection information and a new perspective on\ndesigning network architectures. All parameters of our proposed framework are\nlearnable end to end, and our method possesses the potential to be applied to\nplug-and-play reconstruction.

        "abstract": "Research on multi-view stereo based on remote sensing images has promoted the\ndevelopment of large-scale urban 3D reconstruction. However, remote sensing\nmulti-view image data suffers from the problems of occlusion and uneven\nbrightness between views during acquisition, which leads to the problem of\nblurred details in depth estimation. To solve the above problem, we re-examine\nthe deformable learning method in the Multi-View Stereo task and propose a\nnovel paradigm based on view Space and Depth deformable Learning (SDL-MVS),\naiming to learn deformable interactions of features in different view spaces\nand deformably model the depth ranges and intervals to enable high accurate\ndepth estimation. Specifically, to solve the problem of view noise caused by\nocclusion and uneven brightness, we propose a Progressive Space deformable\nSampling (PSS) mechanism, which performs deformable learning of sampling points\nin the 3D frustum space and the 2D image space in a progressive manner to embed\nsource features to the reference feature adaptively. To further optimize the\ndepth, we introduce Depth Hypothesis deformable Discretization (DHD), which\nachieves precise positioning of the depth prior by adaptively adjusting the\ndepth range hypothesis and performing deformable discretization of the depth\ninterval hypothesis. Finally, our SDL-MVS achieves explicit modeling of\nocclusion and uneven brightness faced in multi-view stereo through the\ndeformable learning paradigm of view space and depth, achieving accurate\nmulti-view depth estimation. Extensive experiments on LuoJia-MVS and WHU\ndatasets show that our SDL-MVS reaches state-of-the-art performance. It is\nworth noting that our SDL-MVS achieves an MAE error of 0.086, an accuracy of\n98.9% for <0.6m, and 98.9% for <3-interval on the LuoJia-MVS dataset under the\npremise of three views as input.",

In the workflow, $\\textit{selecting\npossibly clean data}$ and $\\textit{model update}$ are iterative. However, their\ninterplay and intrinsic characteristics hinder the robustness and efficiency of\nlearning with noisy labels: 1) The model chooses clean data with selection\nbias, leading to the accumulated error in the model update. 2) Most selection\nstrategies leverage partner networks or supplementary information to mitigate\nlabel corruption, albeit with increased computation resources and lower\nthroughput speed. Therefore, we employ only one network with the jump manner\nupdate to decouple the interplay and mine more semantic information from the\nloss for a more precise selection.

To address these limitations, we propose SMAAT, a new AT algorithm\nthat leverages the manifold conjecture, stating that off-manifold AEs lead to\nbetter robustness while on-manifold AEs result in better generalization.\nSpecifically, SMAAT aims at generating a higher proportion of off-manifold AEs\nby perturbing the intermediate deepnet layer with the lowest intrinsic\ndimension. This systematically results in better scalability compared to\nclassical AT as it reduces the PGD chains length required for generating the\nAEs. Additionally, our study provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first\nexplanation for the difference in the generalization and robustness trends\nbetween vision and language models, ie., AT results in a drop in generalization\nin vision models whereas, in encoder-based language models, generalization\neither improves or remains unchanged. We show that vision transformers and\ndecoder-based models tend to have low intrinsic dimensionality in the earlier\nlayers of the network (more off-manifold AEs), while encoder-based models have\nlow intrinsic dimensionality in the later layers. We demonstrate the efficacy\nof SMAAT; on several tasks, including robustifying (i) sentiment classifiers,\n(ii) safety filters in decoder-based models, and (iii) retrievers in RAG\nsetups.

        "abstract": "Autonomous navigation across unstructured terrains, including forests and\nconstruction areas, faces unique challenges due to intricate obstacles and the\nelement of the unknown. Lacking pre-existing maps, these scenarios necessitate\na motion planning approach that combines agility with efficiency. Critically,\nit must also incorporate the robot's kinematic constraints to navigate more\neffectively through complex environments. This work introduces a novel planning\nmethod for center-articulated vehicles (CAV), leveraging motion primitives\nwithin a receding horizon planning framework using onboard sensing. The\napproach commences with the offline creation of motion primitives, generated\nthrough forward simulations that reflect the distinct kinematic model of\ncenter-articulated vehicles. These primitives undergo evaluation through a\nheuristic-based scoring function, facilitating the selection of the most\nsuitable path for real-time navigation. To augment this planning process, we\ndevelop a pose-stabilizing controller, tailored to the kinematic specifications\nof center-articulated vehicles. During experiments, our method demonstrates a\n$67\\%$ improvement in SPL (Success Rate weighted by Path Length) performance\nover existing strategies. Furthermore, its efficacy was validated through\nreal-world experiments conducted with a tree harvester vehicle - SAHA.",

        "abstract": "This work studies embedding of arbitrary VC classes in well-behaved VC\nclasses, focusing particularly on extremal classes. Our main result expresses\nan impossibility: such embeddings necessarily require a significant increase in\ndimension. In particular, we prove that for every $d$ there is a class with VC\ndimension $d$ that cannot be embedded in any extremal class of VC dimension\nsmaller than exponential in $d$.\n  In addition to its independent interest, this result has an important\nimplication in learning theory, as it reveals a fundamental limitation of one\nof the most extensively studied approaches to tackling the long-standing sample\ncompression conjecture. Concretely, the approach proposed by Floyd and Warmuth\nentails embedding any given VC class into an extremal class of a comparable\ndimension, and then applying an optimal sample compression scheme for extremal\nclasses. However, our results imply that this strategy would in some cases\nresult in a sample compression scheme at least exponentially larger than what\nis predicted by the sample compression conjecture.\n  The above implications follow from a general result we prove: any extremal\nclass with VC dimension $d$ has dual VC dimension at most $2d+1$. This bound is\nexponentially smaller than the classical bound $2^{d+1}-1$ of Assouad, which\napplies to general concept classes (and is known to be unimprovable for some\nclasses). We in fact prove a stronger result, establishing that $2d+1$ upper\nbounds the dual Radon number of extremal classes. This theorem represents an\nabstraction of the classical Radon theorem for convex sets, extending its\napplicability to a wider combinatorial framework, without relying on the\nspecifics of Euclidean convexity. The proof utilizes the topological method and\nis primarily based on variants of the Topological Radon Theorem.",

However,\ndespite its significant potential, further fundamental issues remain to be\naddressed, such as the acquisition of accurate channel information. Indeed, the\nconventional angular-domain channel representation is no longer adequate for\ncharacterizing the sparsity inherent in holographic MIMO channels. To fill this\nknowledge gap, in this article, we conceive a decomposition and reconstruction\n(DeRe)-based framework for facilitating the estimation of sparse channels in\nholographic MIMOs. In particular, the channel parameters involved in the\nsteering vector, namely the azimuth and elevation angles plus the distance\n(AED), are decomposed for independently constructing their own covariance\nmatrices. Then, the acquisition of each parameter can be formulated as a\ncompressive sensing (CS) problem by harnessing the covariance matrix associated\nwith each individual parameter. We demonstrate that our solution exhibits an\nimproved performance and imposes a reduced pilot overhead, despite its reduced\ncomplexity. Finally, promising open research topics are highlighted to bridge\nthe gap between the theory and the practical employment of holographic MIMO\nschemes.",

Recent studies have employed an auxiliary encoder to identify a\ncorresponding representation from a sample and to adjust the dimensionality of\na latent variable z. Meanwhile, this auxiliary structure invokes information\nsplit problem because the diffusion and the auxiliary encoder would divide the\ninformation from the sample into two representations for each model.\nParticularly, the information modeled by the diffusion becomes over-regularized\nbecause of the static prior distribution on xT. To address this problem, we\nintroduce Diffusion Bridge AuteEncoders (DBAE), which enable z-dependent\nendpoint xT inference through a feed-forward architecture. This structure\ncreates an information bottleneck at z, so xT becomes dependent on z in its\ngeneration. This results in two consequences: 1) z holds the full information\nof samples, and 2) xT becomes a learnable distribution, not static any further.\nWe propose an objective function for DBAE to enable both reconstruction and\ngenerative modeling, with their theoretical justification. Empirical evidence\nsupports the effectiveness of the intended design in DBAE, which notably\nenhances downstream inference quality, reconstruction, and disentanglement.\nAdditionally, DBAE generates high-fidelity samples in the unconditional\ngeneration.",

In such MDPs, two measures of\ncomplexity have appeared in the literature: the diameter, $D$, and the optimal\nbias span, $H$, which satisfy $H\\leq D$. Prior work have studied the complexity\nof $\\varepsilon$-optimal policy identification only when a generative model is\navailable. In this case, it is known that there exists an MDP with $D \\simeq H$\nfor which the sample complexity to output an $\\varepsilon$-optimal policy is\n$\\Omega(SAD/\\varepsilon^2)$ where $S$ and $A$ are the sizes of the state and\naction spaces. Recently, an algorithm with a sample complexity of order\n$SAH/\\varepsilon^2$ has been proposed, but it requires the knowledge of $H$. We\nfirst show that the sample complexity required to estimate $H$ is not bounded\nby any function of $S,A$ and $H$, ruling out the possibility to easily make the\nprevious algorithm agnostic to $H$. By relying instead on a diameter estimation\nprocedure, we propose the first algorithm for $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-PAC policy\nidentification that does not need any form of prior knowledge on the MDP. Its\nsample complexity scales in $SAD/\\varepsilon^2$ in the regime of small\n$\\varepsilon$, which is near-optimal. In the online setting, our first\ncontribution is a lower bound which implies that a sample complexity polynomial\nin $H$ cannot be achieved in this setting.

However, the sparse-group lasso can be\ncomputationally more expensive than both the lasso and group lasso, due to the\nadded shrinkage complexity, and its additional hyper-parameter that needs\ntuning. In this paper a novel dual feature reduction method, Dual Feature\nReduction (DFR), is presented that uses strong screening rules for the\nsparse-group lasso and the adaptive sparse-group lasso to reduce their input\nspace before optimization. DFR applies two layers of screening and is based on\nthe dual norms of the sparse-group lasso and adaptive sparse-group lasso.\nThrough synthetic and real numerical studies, it is shown that the proposed\nfeature reduction approach is able to drastically reduce the computational cost\nin many different scenarios.",

While such sparse learned\nstructures achieve effectiveness far beyond those of traditional inverted\nindex-based rankers, there is still a gap in effectiveness to the best dense\nretrievers, or even to sparse methods that leverage more expensive\noptimizations such as query expansion and query term weighting. We focus on\nnarrowing this gap by revisiting and optimizing DeepImpact, a sparse retrieval\napproach that uses DocT5Query for document expansion followed by a BERT\nlanguage model to learn impact scores for document terms. We first\nreinvestigate the expansion process and find that the recently proposed\nDoc2Query query filtration does not enhance retrieval quality when used with\nDeepImpact. Instead, substituting T5 with a fine-tuned Llama 2 model for query\nprediction results in a considerable improvement.

Inspired by classical matrix and tensor factorization techniques, our\nmethod represents and approximates dense clusters of Gaussians with\nsignificantly fewer Gaussians through efficient factorization. We aim to\nefficiently represent dense 3D Gaussians by approximating them with a limited\namount of information for each axis and their combinations. This method allows\nus to encode a substantially large number of Gaussians along with their\nessential attributes -- such as color, scale, and rotation -- necessary for\nrendering using a relatively small number of elements.

        "abstract": "The success of the text-guided diffusion model has inspired the development\nand release of numerous powerful diffusion models within the open-source\ncommunity. These models are typically fine-tuned on various expert datasets,\nshowcasing diverse denoising capabilities. Leveraging multiple high-quality\nmodels to produce stronger generation ability is valuable, but has not been\nextensively studied. Existing methods primarily adopt parameter merging\nstrategies to produce a new static model. However, they overlook the fact that\nthe divergent denoising capabilities of the models may dynamically change\nacross different states, such as when experiencing different prompts, initial\nnoises, denoising steps, and spatial locations. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel ensembling method, Adaptive Feature Aggregation (AFA), which dynamically\nadjusts the contributions of multiple models at the feature level according to\nvarious states (i.e., prompts, initial noises, denoising steps, and spatial\nlocations), thereby keeping the advantages of multiple diffusion models, while\nsuppressing their disadvantages. Specifically, we design a lightweight\nSpatial-Aware Block-Wise (SABW) feature aggregator that adaptive aggregates the\nblock-wise intermediate features from multiple U-Net denoisers into a unified\none. The core idea lies in dynamically producing an individual attention map\nfor each model's features by comprehensively considering various states. It is\nworth noting that only SABW is trainable with about 50 million parameters,\nwhile other models are frozen. Both the quantitative and qualitative\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Adaptive Feature\nAggregation method. The code is available at https://github.com/tenvence/afa/.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks have been the predominant paradigm in machine learning\nfor solving cognitive tasks. Such models, however, are restricted by a high\ncomputational overhead, limiting their applicability and hindering advancements\nin the field. Extensive research demonstrated that pruning structures from\nthese models is a straightforward approach to reducing network complexity. In\nthis direction, most efforts focus on removing weights or filters. Studies have\nalso been devoted to layer pruning as it promotes superior computational gains.\nHowever, layer pruning often hurts the network predictive ability (i.e.,\naccuracy) at high compression rates. This work introduces an effective\nlayer-pruning strategy that meets all underlying properties pursued by pruning\nmethods. Our method estimates the relative importance of a layer using the\nCentered Kernel Alignment (CKA) metric, employed to measure the similarity\nbetween the representations of the unpruned model and a candidate layer for\npruning. We confirm the effectiveness of our method on standard architectures\nand benchmarks, in which it outperforms existing layer-pruning strategies and\nother state-of-the-art pruning techniques. Particularly, we remove more than\n75% of computation while improving predictive ability. At higher compression\nregimes, our method exhibits negligible accuracy drop, while other methods\nnotably deteriorate model accuracy. Apart from these benefits, our pruned\nmodels exhibit robustness to adversarial and out-of-distribution samples.",

Our rules can be applied to propositional logic formulae in nested\nform, are equivalence-preserving, guarantee a monotonically decreasing number\nof variables, clauses and literals, and maximise the preservation of structural\nproblem information. Our techniques can also be seen as higher-level SAT\npreprocessing, and we show how one of our rules (TWSR) generalises and\nstreamlines most of the known equivalence-preserving SAT preprocessing methods.\nIn addition, we propose a simplification procedure based on the systematic\napplication of two of our rules (EPR and TWSR) which is solver-agnostic and can\nbe used to simplify large Boolean satisfiability problems and propositional\nformulae in arbitrary form, and we provide a formal analysis of its algorithmic\ncomplexity in terms of space and time. Finally, we show how our rules can be\nfurther extended with a novel n-ary implication graph to capture all known\nequivalence-preserving preprocessing procedures.",

        "abstract": "Accurate mid-term (weeks to one year) hourly electricity load forecasts are\nessential for strategic decision-making in power plant operation, ensuring\nsupply security and grid stability, and energy trading. While numerous models\neffectively predict short-term (hours to a few days) hourly load, mid-term\nforecasting solutions remain scarce. In mid-term load forecasting, besides\ndaily, weekly, and annual seasonal and autoregressive effects, capturing\nweather and holiday effects, as well as socio-economic non-stationarities in\nthe data, poses significant modeling challenges. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a novel forecasting method using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)\nbuilt from interpretable P-splines and enhanced with autoregressive\npost-processing. This model uses smoothed temperatures, Error-Trend-Seasonal\n(ETS) modeled non-stationary states, a nuanced representation of holiday\neffects with weekday variations, and seasonal information as input. The\nproposed model is evaluated on load data from 24 European countries. This\nanalysis demonstrates that the model not only has significantly enhanced\nforecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods but also offers\nvaluable insights into the influence of individual components on predicted\nload, given its full interpretability. Achieving performance akin to day-ahead\nTSO forecasts in fast computation times of a few seconds for several years of\nhourly data underscores the model's potential for practical application in the\npower system industry.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by the software industry's practice of offering different editions\nor versions of a product tailored to specific user groups or use cases, we\npropose a novel task, namely, training-free editioning, for text-to-image\nmodels. Specifically, we aim to create variations of a base text-to-image model\nwithout retraining, enabling the model to cater to the diverse needs of\ndifferent user groups or to offer distinct features and functionalities. To\nachieve this, we propose that different editions of a given text-to-image model\ncan be formulated as concept subspaces in the latent space of its text encoder\n(e.g., CLIP). In such a concept subspace, all points satisfy a specific user\nneed (e.g., generating images of a cat lying on the grass/ground/falling\nleaves). Technically, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to obtain the\ndesired concept subspaces from representative text embedding that correspond to\na specific user need or requirement. Projecting the text embedding of a given\nprompt into these low-dimensional subspaces enables efficient model editioning\nwithout retraining. Intuitively, our proposed editioning paradigm enables a\nservice provider to customize the base model into its \"cat edition\" (or other\neditions) that restricts image generation to cats, regardless of the user's\nprompt (e.g., dogs, people, etc.). This introduces a new dimension for product\ndifferentiation, targeted functionality, and pricing strategies, unlocking\nnovel business models for text-to-image generators. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate the validity of our approach and its potential to enable a\nwide range of customized text-to-image model editions across various domains\nand applications.",

        "abstract": "The rapid evolution of wireless technologies and the growing complexity of\nnetwork infrastructures necessitate a paradigm shift in how communication\nnetworks are designed, configured, and managed. Recent advancements in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to\nrevolutionize wireless communication systems. However, existing studies on LLMs\nfor wireless systems are limited to a direct application for telecom language\nunderstanding. To empower LLMs with knowledge and expertise in the wireless\ndomain, this paper proposes WirelessLLM, a comprehensive framework for adapting\nand enhancing LLMs to address the unique challenges and requirements of\nwireless communication networks. We first identify three foundational\nprinciples that underpin WirelessLLM: knowledge alignment, knowledge fusion,\nand knowledge evolution. Then, we investigate the enabling technologies to\nbuild WirelessLLM, including prompt engineering, retrieval augmented\ngeneration, tool usage, multi-modal pre-training, and domain-specific\nfine-tuning. Moreover, we present three case studies to demonstrate the\npractical applicability and benefits of WirelessLLM for solving typical\nproblems in wireless networks. Finally, we conclude this paper by highlighting\nkey challenges and outlining potential avenues for future research.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17052v1",
        "abstract": "Long prompt leads to huge hardware costs when using Large Language Models\n(LLMs). Unfortunately, many tasks, such as summarization, inevitably introduce\nlong task-inputs, and the wide application of in-context learning easily makes\nthe prompt length explode. Inspired by the language understanding ability of\nLLMs, this paper proposes SelfCP, which uses the LLM \\textbf{itself} to\n\\textbf{C}ompress long \\textbf{P}rompt into compact virtual tokens. SelfCP\napplies a general frozen LLM twice, first as an encoder to compress the prompt\nand then as a decoder to generate responses. Specifically, given a long prompt,\nwe place special tokens within the lengthy segment for compression and signal\nthe LLM to generate $k$ virtual tokens. Afterward, the virtual tokens\nconcatenate with the uncompressed prompt and are fed into the same LLM to\ngenerate the response. In general, SelfCP facilitates the unconditional and\nconditional compression of prompts, fitting both standard tasks and those with\nspecific objectives. Since the encoder and decoder are frozen, SelfCP only\ncontains 17M trainable parameters and allows for convenient adaptation across\nvarious backbones. We implement SelfCP with two LLM backbones and evaluate it\nin both in- and out-domain tasks. Results show that the compressed virtual\ntokens can substitute $12 \\times$ larger original prompts effectively",

        "abstract": "Data-driven deep learning has emerged as the new paradigm to model complex\nphysical space-time systems. These data-driven methods learn patterns by\noptimizing statistical metrics and tend to overlook the adherence to physical\nlaws, unlike traditional model-driven numerical methods. Thus, they often\ngenerate predictions that are not physically realistic. On the other hand, by\nsampling a large amount of high quality predictions from a data-driven model,\nsome predictions will be more physically plausible than the others and closer\nto what will happen in the future. Based on this observation, we propose\n\\emph{Beam search by Vector Quantization} (BeamVQ) to enhance the physical\nalignment of data-driven space-time forecasting models. The key of BeamVQ is to\ntrain model on self-generated samples filtered with physics-aware metrics. To\nbe flexibly support different backbone architectures, BeamVQ leverages a code\nbank to transform any encoder-decoder model to the continuous state space into\ndiscrete codes. Afterwards, it iteratively employs beam search to sample\nhigh-quality sequences, retains those with the highest physics-aware scores,\nand trains model on the new dataset. Comprehensive experiments show that BeamVQ\nnot only gave an average statistical skill score boost for more than 32% for\nten backbones on five datasets, but also significantly enhances physics-aware\nmetrics.",

        "abstract": "Split learning, as one of the most common architectures in vertical federated\nlearning, has gained widespread use in industry due to its privacy-preserving\ncharacteristics. In this architecture, the party holding the labels seeks\ncooperation from other parties to improve model performance due to insufficient\nfeature data. Each of these participants has a self-defined bottom model to\nlearn hidden representations from its own feature data and uploads the\nembedding vectors to the top model held by the label holder for final\npredictions. This design allows participants to conduct joint training without\ndirectly exchanging data. However, existing research points out that malicious\nparticipants may still infer label information from the uploaded embeddings,\nleading to privacy leakage. In this paper, we first propose an embedding\nextension attack that manually modifies embeddings to undermine existing\ndefense strategies, which rely on constraining the correlation between the\nembeddings uploaded by participants and the labels. Subsequently, we propose a\nnew label obfuscation defense strategy, called `LabObf', which randomly maps\neach original one-hot vector label to multiple numerical soft labels with\nvalues intertwined, significantly increasing the difficulty for attackers to\ninfer the labels. We conduct experiments on four different types of datasets,\nand the results show that LabObf can reduce the attacker's success rate to near\nrandom guessing while maintaining an acceptable model accuracy.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17039v1",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed a paradigm shift in natural\nlanguage processing, yet their limited controllability poses a significant\nchallenge for downstream applications. We aim to address this by drawing\ninspiration from the neural mechanisms of the human brain, specifically Broca's\nand Wernicke's areas, which are crucial for language generation and\ncomprehension, respectively. In particular, Broca's area receives cognitive\ndecision signals from Wernicke's area, treating the language generation as an\nintricate decision-making process, which differs from the fully auto-regressive\nlanguage generation of existing LLMs. In a similar vein, our proposed system,\nthe BWArea model, conceptualizes language generation as a decision-making task.\nThis model has three components: a language world model, an inverse dynamics\nmodel, and a cognitive policy. Like Wernicke's area, the inverse dynamics model\nis designed to deduce the underlying cognitive intentions, or latent actions,\nbehind each token. The BWArea model is amenable to both pre-training and\nfine-tuning like existing LLMs. With 30B clean pre-training tokens, we have\ntrained a BWArea model, which achieves competitive performance with LLMs of\nequal size (1B parameters). Unlike fully auto-regressive LLMs, its pre-training\nperformance does not degenerate if dirty data unintentionally appears. This\nshows the advantage of a decomposed structure of BWArea model in reducing\nefforts in laborious data selection and labeling. Finally, we reveal that the\nBWArea model offers enhanced controllability via fine-tuning the cognitive\npolicy with downstream reward metrics, thereby facilitating alignment with\ngreater simplicity. On 9 out of 10 tasks from two suites, TextWorld and\nBigBench Hard, our method shows superior performance to auto-regressive LLMs.",

Moreover, it\nis challenging to enhance the performance of binarized models by increasing the\nnumber of binarized convolutional layers, which limits their practicability for\n3D occupancy prediction. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel binarized\ndeep convolution (BDC) unit that effectively enhances performance while\nincreasing the number of binarized convolutional layers.

Therefore, additional binarized\nconvolutional layers are constrained to 1 \\times 1 in the BDC unit. Secondly,\nwe introduce the per-channel weight branch to mitigate the impact of\nbinarization errors from unimportant channel features on the performance of\nbinarized models, thereby improving performance while increasing the number of\nbinarized convolutional layers. Furthermore, we decompose the 3D occupancy\nnetwork into four convolutional modules and utilize the proposed BDC unit to\nbinarize these modules.

SCaRL is a large dataset based on the CARLA Simulator, which\nprovides data for diverse, dynamic scenarios and traffic conditions.

The Gradient\nConsistency Model penalises the data term for view pairs that have a mismatch\nbetween the spatial gradients in the source view and the spatial gradients in\nthe target view.

Contact interactions\nresult from complex physical phenomena, that can be mathematically cast as\nNonlinear Complementarity Problems (NCPs) in the context of rigid or compliant\npoint contact interactions. Such a class of complementarity problems is, in\ngeneral, difficult to solve both from an optimization and numerical\nperspective. Over the past decades, dedicated and specialized contact solvers,\nimplemented in modern robotics simulators (e.g., Bullet, Drake, MuJoCo, DART,\nRaisim) have emerged. Yet, most of these solvers tend either to solve a relaxed\nformulation of the original contact problems (at the price of physical\ninconsistencies) or to scale poorly with the problem dimension or its numerical\nconditioning (e.g., a robotic hand manipulating a paper sheet). In this paper,\nwe introduce a unified and efficient approach to solving NCPs in the context of\ncontact simulation. It relies on a sound combination of the Alternating\nDirection Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and proximal algorithms to account for\nboth compliant and rigid contact interfaces in a unified way. To handle\nill-conditioned problems and accelerate the convergence rate, we also propose\nan efficient update strategy to adapt the ADMM hyperparameters automatically.\nBy leveraging proximal methods, we also propose new algorithmic solutions to\nefficiently evaluate the inverse dynamics involving rigid and compliant contact\ninteractions, extending the approach developed in MuJoCo. We validate the\nefficiency and robustness of our contact solver against several alternative\ncontact methods of the literature and benchmark them on various robotics and\ngranular mechanics scenarios.

The cohesive element, developed based on the cohesive zone\nmodel, is widely used for modeling delamination.

This work develops a new set\nof elements for modelling composite plies and their interfaces in 3D. A\ntriangular Kirchhoff-Love shell element is developed for orthotropic materials\nto model the plies. A structural cohesive element, conforming to the shell\nelements of the plies, is developed to model the interface delamination. The\nproposed method is verified and validated on the classical benchmark problems\nof Mode I, Mode II, and mixed-mode delamination of unidirectional laminates, as\nwell as on the single-leg bending problem of a multi-directional laminate. All\nthe results show that the element size in the proposed models can be ten times\nlarger than that in the standard cohesive element models, with more than 90%\nreduction in CPU time, while retaining prediction accuracy.

        "abstract": "The burgeoning volume of graph data presents significant computational\nchallenges in training graph neural networks (GNNs), critically impeding their\nefficiency in various applications. To tackle this challenge, graph\ncondensation (GC) has emerged as a promising acceleration solution, focusing on\nthe synthesis of a compact yet representative graph for efficiently training\nGNNs while retaining performance. Despite the potential to promote scalable use\nof GNNs, existing GC methods are limited to aligning the condensed graph with\nmerely the observed static graph distribution. This limitation significantly\nrestricts the generalization capacity of condensed graphs, particularly in\nadapting to dynamic distribution changes. In real-world scenarios, however,\ngraphs are dynamic and constantly evolving, with new nodes and edges being\ncontinually integrated. Consequently, due to the limited generalization\ncapacity of condensed graphs, applications that employ GC for efficient GNN\ntraining end up with sub-optimal GNNs when confronted with evolving graph\nstructures and distributions in dynamic real-world situations. To overcome this\nissue, we propose open-world graph condensation (OpenGC), a robust GC framework\nthat integrates structure-aware distribution shift to simulate evolving graph\npatterns and exploit the temporal environments for invariance condensation.\nThis approach is designed to extract temporal invariant patterns from the\noriginal graph, thereby enhancing the generalization capabilities of the\ncondensed graph and, subsequently, the GNNs trained on it. Extensive\nexperiments on both real-world and synthetic evolving graphs demonstrate that\nOpenGC outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) GC methods in adapting to dynamic\nchanges in open-world graph environments.",

Specifically, GSC ensures the preservation of\ngeometrical structures within and between modalities, allowing for the accurate\ndiscrimination of noisy samples based on structural differences.

The previous study found that the high\npositivity or negativity at the sentence level may indirectly impact the writer\nhim/herself, or the reader. In this way, we could highlight specific paths of\nGentoo as the most affected by negative emotions, and show how negative\nemotions have evolved and changed along the same paths.\n  By joining the analysis of the mailing lists, from which we derive the\nsentiment of the developers, with the information derived from the development\nlogs, we obtained a longitudinal picture of how development paths have been\nhistorically affected by positive or negative emotions.

Various automatic picking\ntechniques based on deep neural networks have been developed to expedite this\nprocedure. The most popular class is using semantic segmentation networks to\npick on a shot gather called 2-dimensional (2-D) picking. Generally, 2-D\nsegmentation-based picking methods input an image of a shot gather, and output\na binary segmentation map, in which the maximum of each column is the location\nof FB. However, current designed segmentation networks is difficult to ensure\nthe horizontal continuity of the segmentation. Additionally, FB jumps also\nexist in some areas, and it is not easy for current networks to detect such\njumps. Therefore, it is important to pick as much as possible and ensure\nhorizontal continuity. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel semantic\nsegmentation network for the 2-D seismic FB picking task, where we introduce\nthe dynamic snake convolution into U-Net and call the new segmentation network\ndynamic-snake U-Net (DSU-Net). Specifically, we develop original dynamic-snake\nconvolution (DSConv) in CV and propose a novel DSConv module, which can extract\nthe horizontal continuous feature in the shallow feature of the shot gather.\nMany experiments have shown that DSU-Net demonstrates higher accuracy and\nrobustness than the other 2-D segmentation-based models, achieving\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 2-D seismic field surveys. Particularly,\nit can effectively detect FB jumps and better ensure the horizontal continuity\nof FB. In addition, the ablation experiment and the anti-noise experiment,\nrespectively, verify the optimal structure of the DSConv module and the\nrobustness of the picking.",

        "abstract": "Advancements in science rely on data sharing. In medicine, where personal\ndata are often involved, synthetic tabular data generated by generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) offer a promising avenue. However, existing GANs\nstruggle to capture the complexities of real-world tabular data, which often\ncontain a mix of continuous and categorical variables with potential imbalances\nand dependencies. We propose a novel correlation- and mean-aware loss function\ndesigned to address these challenges as a regularizer for GANs. To ensure a\nrigorous evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmarking framework using\nten real-world datasets and eight established tabular GAN baselines. The\nproposed loss function demonstrates statistically significant improvements over\nexisting methods in capturing the true data distribution, significantly\nenhancing the quality of synthetic data generated with GANs. The benchmarking\nframework shows that the enhanced synthetic data quality leads to improved\nperformance in downstream machine learning (ML) tasks, ultimately paving the\nway for easier data sharing.",

The MQM\nerror typology has been widely used by practitioners in the translation and\nlocalization industry and has served as the basis for many derivative projects.\nThe annual Conference on Machine Translation (WMT) shared tasks on both human\nand automatic translation quality evaluations used the MQM error typology.\n  The metric stands on two pillars: error typology and the scoring model. The\nscoring model calculates the quality score from annotation data, detailing how\nto convert error type and severity counts into numeric scores to determine if\nthe content meets specifications. Previously, only the raw scoring model had\nbeen published. This April, the MQM Council published the Linear Calibrated\nScoring Model, officially presented herein, along with the Non-Linear Scoring\nModel, which had not been published before.\n  This paper details the latest MQM developments and presents a universal\napproach to translation quality measurement across three sample size ranges. It\nalso explains why Statistical Quality Control should be used for very small\nsample sizes, starting from a single sentence.",

Weight averaging methods aim at balancing the generalization\nof ensembling and the inference speed of a single model by averaging the\nparameters of an ensemble of models. Yet, naive averaging results in poor\nperformance as models converge to different loss basins, and aligning the\nmodels to improve the performance of the average is challenging. Alternatively,\ninspired by distributed training, methods like DART and PAPA have been proposed\nto train several models in parallel such that they will end up in the same\nbasin, resulting in good averaging accuracy. However, these methods either\ncompromise ensembling accuracy or demand significant communication between\nmodels during training. In this paper, we introduce WASH, a novel distributed\nmethod for training model ensembles for weight averaging that achieves\nstate-of-the-art image classification accuracy. WASH maintains models within\nthe same basin by randomly shuffling a small percentage of weights during\ntraining, resulting in diverse models and lower communication costs compared to\nstandard parameter averaging methods.",

The\nnovelty compared to classical neural network architecture is that it explicitly\nincorporates time warping ability, as well as a new way of considering\nattention. In addition, this architecture is capable of learning a dropout\nstrategy, thus optimizing its own architecture.Behind the design of this\narchitecture, our overall objective is threefold: firstly, we are aiming at\nimproving the accuracy of instance based classification approaches that shows\nquite good performances as far as enough training data is available. Secondly\nwe seek to reduce the computational complexity inherent to these methods to\nimprove their scalability. Ideally, we seek to find an acceptable balance\nbetween these first two criteria. And finally, we seek to enhance the\nexplainability of the decision provided by this kind of neural architecture.The\nexperiment demonstrates that the stochastic gradient descent implemented to\ntrain a teNN is quite effective. To the extent that the selection of some\ncritical meta-parameters is correct, convergence is generally smooth and\nfast.While maintaining good accuracy, we get a drastic gain in scalability by\nfirst reducing the required number of reference time series, i.e. the number of\nteNN cells required. Secondly, we demonstrate that, during the training\nprocess, the teNN succeeds in reducing the number of neurons required within\neach cell. Finally, we show that the analysis of the activation and attention\nmatrices as well as the reference time series after training provides relevant\ninformation to interpret and explain the classification results.The comparative\nstudy that we have carried out and which concerns around thirty diverse and\nmultivariate datasets shows that the teNN obtains results comparable to those\nof the state of the art, in particular similar to those of a network mixing\nLSTM and CNN architectures for example.",

Asynchronous\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has been widely explored in such a setting to\nreduce the synchronization overhead associated with parallelization. However,\nthe performance of asynchronous SGD algorithms often depends on a bounded\ndissimilarity condition among the workers' local data, a condition that can\ndrastically affect their efficiency when the workers' data are highly\nheterogeneous. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the\n\\textit{dual-delayed asynchronous SGD (DuDe-ASGD)} algorithm designed to\nneutralize the adverse effects of data heterogeneity. DuDe-ASGD makes full use\nof stale stochastic gradients from all workers during asynchronous training,\nleading to two distinct time lags in the model parameters and data samples\nutilized in the server's iterations. Furthermore, by adopting an incremental\naggregation strategy, DuDe-ASGD maintains a per-iteration computational cost\nthat is on par with traditional asynchronous SGD algorithms. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that DuDe-ASGD achieves a near-minimax-optimal convergence rate\nfor smooth nonconvex problems, even when the data across workers are extremely\nheterogeneous. Numerical experiments indicate that DuDe-ASGD compares favorably\nwith existing asynchronous and synchronous SGD-based algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Timely status updating is the premise of emerging interaction-based\napplications in the Internet of Things (IoT). Using redundant devices to update\nthe status of interest is a promising method to improve the timeliness of\ninformation. However, parallel status updating leads to out-of-order arrivals\nat the monitor, significantly challenging timeliness analysis. This work\nstudies the Age of Information (AoI) of a multi-queue status update system\nwhere multiple devices monitor the same physical process. Specifically, two\nsystems are considered: the Basic System, which only has type-1 devices that\nare ad hoc devices located close to the source, and the Hybrid System, which\ncontains additional type-2 devices that are infrastructure-based devices\nlocated in fixed points compared to the Basic System. Using the Stochastic\nHybrid Systems (SHS) framework, a mathematical model that combines discrete and\ncontinuous dynamics, we derive the expressions of the average AoI of the\nconsidered two systems in closed form. Numerical results verify the accuracy of\nthe analysis. It is shown that when the number and parameters of the type-1\ndevices/type-2 devices are fixed, the logarithm of average AoI will linearly\ndecrease with the logarithm of the total arrival rate of type-2 devices or that\nof the number of type-1 devices under specific condition. It has also been\ndemonstrated that the proposed systems can significantly outperform the FCFS\nM/M/N status update system.",

We define and explore the model's cognitive and\nexpressive capabilities through linear representations across three critical\nphases: Pretraining, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning\nfrom Human Feedback (RLHF). Cognitive capability is defined as the quantity and\nquality of information conveyed by the neuron output vectors within the\nnetwork, similar to the neural signal processing in human cognition. Expressive\ncapability is defined as the model's capability to produce word-level output.\nOur findings unveil a sequential development pattern, where cognitive abilities\nare largely established during Pretraining, whereas expressive abilities\npredominantly advance during SFT and RLHF. Statistical analyses confirm a\nsignificant correlation between the two capabilities, suggesting that cognitive\ncapacity may limit expressive potential. The paper also explores the\ntheoretical underpinnings of these divergent developmental trajectories and\ntheir connection to the LLMs' architectural design. Moreover, we evaluate\nvarious optimization-independent strategies, such as few-shot learning and\nrepeated sampling, which bridge the gap between cognitive and expressive\ncapabilities.

One particularly concerning method\nis Image Steganography, allowing individuals to hide illegal information in\ndigital images without arousing suspicions. Such a technique pose severe\nsecurity risks, making it crucial to develop effective steganalysis methods\nenabling to detect manipulated images for clandestine communications. Although\nsignificant advancements have been achieved with machine learning models, a\ncritical issue remains: the disparity between the controlled datasets used to\ntrain steganalysis models against real-world datasets of forensic\npractitioners, undermining severely the practical effectiveness of standardized\nsteganalysis models. In this paper, we address this issue focusing on a\nrealistic scenario where practitioners lack crucial information about the\nlimited target set of images under analysis, including details about their\ndevelopment process and even whereas it contains manipulated images or not. By\nleveraging geometric alignment and distribution matching of source and target\nresiduals, we develop TADA (Target Alignment through Data Adaptation), a novel\nmethodology enabling to emulate sources aligned with specific targets in\nsteganalysis, which is also relevant for highly unbalanced targets.

        "abstract": "There has been a recent surge of interest in learning to perceive depth from\nmonocular videos in an unsupervised fashion. A key challenge in this field is\nachieving robust and accurate depth estimation in challenging scenarios,\nparticularly in regions with weak textures or where dynamic objects are\npresent. This study makes three major contributions by delving deeply into\ndense correspondence priors to provide existing frameworks with explicit\ngeometric constraints. The first novelty is a contextual-geometric depth\nconsistency loss, which employs depth maps triangulated from dense\ncorrespondences based on estimated ego-motion to guide the learning of depth\nperception from contextual information, since explicitly triangulated depth\nmaps capture accurate relative distances among pixels. The second novelty\narises from the observation that there exists an explicit, deducible\nrelationship between optical flow divergence and depth gradient. A differential\nproperty correlation loss is, therefore, designed to refine depth estimation\nwith a specific emphasis on local variations. The third novelty is a\nbidirectional stream co-adjustment strategy that enhances the interaction\nbetween rigid and optical flows, encouraging the former towards more accurate\ncorrespondence and making the latter more adaptable across various scenarios\nunder the static scene hypotheses. DCPI-Depth, a framework that incorporates\nall these innovative components and couples two bidirectional and collaborative\nstreams, achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizability across\nmultiple public datasets, outperforming all existing prior arts. Specifically,\nit demonstrates accurate depth estimation in texture-less and dynamic regions,\nand shows more reasonable smoothness.",

A growing research direction\nattempts to employ diffusion models to perform downstream vision tasks by\nexploiting their deep understanding of image semantics. Yet, the majority of\nthese approaches have focused on image-related tasks like semantic\ncorrespondence and segmentation, with less emphasis on video tasks such as VSS.\nIdeally, diffusion-based image semantic segmentation approaches can be applied\nto videos in a frame-by-frame manner. However, we find their performance on\nvideos to be subpar due to the absence of any modeling of temporal information\ninherent in the video data. To this end, we tackle this problem and introduce a\nframework tailored for VSS based on pre-trained image and video diffusion\nmodels. We propose building a scene context model based on the diffusion\nfeatures, where the model is autoregressively updated to adapt to scene\nchanges. This context model predicts per-frame coarse segmentation maps that\nare temporally consistent. To refine these maps further, we propose a\ncorrespondence-based refinement strategy that aggregates predictions\ntemporally, resulting in more confident predictions. Finally, we introduce a\nmasked modulation approach to upsample the coarse maps to the full resolution\nat a high quality. Experiments show that our proposed approach outperforms\nexisting zero-shot image semantic segmentation approaches significantly on\nvarious VSS benchmarks without any training or fine-tuning. Moreover, it rivals\nsupervised VSS approaches on the VSPW dataset despite not being explicitly\ntrained for VSS.",

Firstly, to\nenhance the transferability of FAS models, we design a Distribution-aware Score\nBiasing module to optimize adversarial face examples away from the distribution\nof spoof images utilizing scores. Secondly, to mitigate the substantial style\ndifferences between live images and adversarial examples initialized with spoof\nimages, we introduce an Instance Style Alignment module that aligns the style\nof adversarial examples with live images. In addition, to alleviate the\nconflicts between the gradients of FR and FAS models, we propose a Gradient\nConsistency Maintenance module to minimize disparities between the gradients\nusing Hessian approximation.

These models are\nfirst pre-trained on some generic large-scale vision-text datasets, and then\nthe learned representations are transferred to the downstream VCR task. Despite\ntheir attractive performance, this paper posits that the VL Transformers do not\nexhibit visual commonsense, which is the key to VCR. In particular, our\nempirical results pinpoint several shortcomings of existing VL Transformers:\nsmall gains from pre-training, unexpected language bias, limited model\narchitecture for the two inseparable sub-tasks, and neglect of the important\nobject-tag correlation.

        "abstract": "Complex networks, which are the abstractions of many real-world systems,\npresent a persistent challenge across disciplines for people to decipher their\nunderlying information. Recently, hyperbolic geometry of latent spaces has\ngained traction in network analysis, due to its ability to preserve certain\nlocal intrinsic properties of the nodes. In this study, we explore the problem\nfrom a much broader perspective: understanding the impact of nodes' global\ntopological structures on latent space placements. Our investigations reveal a\ndirect correlation between the topological structure of nodes and their\npositioning within the latent space. Building on this deep and strong\nconnection between node distance and network topology, we propose a novel\nembedding framework called Topology-encoded Latent Hyperbolic Geometry (TopoLa)\nfor analyzing complex networks. With the encoded topological information in the\nlatent space, TopoLa is capable of enhancing both conventional and low-rank\nnetworks, using the singular value gap to clarify the mathematical principles\nbehind this enhancement. Meanwhile, we show that the equipped TopoLa distance\ncan also help augment pivotal deep learning models encompassing knowledge\ndistillation and contrastive learning.",

Conventional\napproaches often employ multi-stage pipelines, which typically consist of\nobject detection, temporal association, and multi-relation classification.\nHowever, these methods exhibit inherent limitations due to the separation of\nmultiple stages, and independent optimization of these sub-problems may yield\nsub-optimal solutions.

This\nframework reformulates the task as a set prediction problem and leverages\npair-wise features to represent each subject-object pair within the scene\ngraph.

In this work, we\ninvestigate CSIvA (Ke et al., 2023), a transformer-based model promising to\ntrain on synthetic data and transfer to real data. First, we bridge the gap\nwith existing identifiability theory and show that constraints on the training\ndata distribution implicitly define a prior on the test observations.\nConsistent with classical approaches, good performance is achieved when we have\na good prior on the test data, and the underlying model is identifiable. At the\nsame time, we find new trade-offs. Training on datasets generated from\ndifferent classes of causal models, unambiguously identifiable in isolation,\nimproves the test generalization. Performance is still guaranteed, as the\nambiguous cases resulting from the mixture of identifiable causal models are\nunlikely to occur (which we formally prove). Overall, our study finds that\namortized causal discovery still needs to obey identifiability theory, but it\nalso differs from classical methods in how the assumptions are formulated,\ntrading more reliance on assumptions on the noise type for fewer hypotheses on\nthe mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "With the emergence of Gaussian Splats, recent efforts have focused on\nlarge-scale scene geometric reconstruction. However, most of these efforts\neither concentrate on memory reduction or spatial space division, neglecting\ninformation in the semantic space. In this paper, we propose a novel method,\nnamed SA-GS, for fine-grained 3D geometry reconstruction using semantic-aware\n3D Gaussian Splats. Specifically, we leverage prior information stored in large\nvision models such as SAM and DINO to generate semantic masks. We then\nintroduce a geometric complexity measurement function to serve as soft\nregularization, guiding the shape of each Gaussian Splat within specific\nsemantic areas. Additionally, we present a method that estimates the expected\nnumber of Gaussian Splats in different semantic areas, effectively providing a\nlower bound for Gaussian Splats in these areas. Subsequently, we extract the\npoint cloud using a novel probability density-based extraction method,\ntransforming Gaussian Splats into a point cloud crucial for downstream tasks.\nOur method also offers the potential for detailed semantic inquiries while\nmaintaining high image-based reconstruction results. We provide extensive\nexperiments on publicly available large-scale scene reconstruction datasets\nwith highly accurate point clouds as ground truth and our novel dataset. Our\nresults demonstrate the superiority of our method over current state-of-the-art\nGaussian Splats reconstruction methods by a significant margin in terms of\ngeometric-based measurement metrics.

Second, plasticity algorithms must leverage the internal\nstate to intelligently regulate plasticity at individual synapses to facilitate\nthe seamless integration of new memories while avoiding detrimental\ninterference with existing ones.

        "abstract": "Flatness of the loss surface not only correlates positively with\ngeneralization but is also related to adversarial robustness, since\nperturbations of inputs relate non-linearly to perturbations of weights. In\nthis paper, we empirically analyze the relation between adversarial examples\nand relative flatness with respect to the parameters of one layer. We observe a\npeculiar property of adversarial examples: during an iterative first-order\nwhite-box attack, the flatness of the loss surface measured around the\nadversarial example first becomes sharper until the label is flipped, but if we\nkeep the attack running it runs into a flat uncanny valley where the label\nremains flipped. We find this phenomenon across various model architectures and\ndatasets. Our results also extend to large language models (LLMs), but due to\nthe discrete nature of the input space and comparatively weak attacks, the\nadversarial examples rarely reach a truly flat region. Most importantly, this\nphenomenon shows that flatness alone cannot explain adversarial robustness\nunless we can also guarantee the behavior of the function around the examples.\nWe theoretically connect relative flatness to adversarial robustness by\nbounding the third derivative of the loss surface, underlining the need for\nflatness in combination with a low global Lipschitz constant for a robust\nmodel.",

These datasets are designed with the goal of\ntraining a model to do well on standard computer vision benchmarks, many of\nwhich, however, have been shown to be English-centric (e.g., ImageNet).\nConsequently, existing data curation techniques gravitate towards using\npredominantly English image-text pairs and discard many potentially useful\nnon-English samples. Our work questions this practice. Multilingual data is\ninherently enriching not only because it provides a gateway to learn about\nculturally salient concepts, but also because it depicts common concepts\ndifferently from monolingual data. We thus conduct a systematic study to\nexplore the performance benefits of using more samples of non-English origins\nwith respect to English vision tasks. By translating all multilingual\nimage-text pairs from a raw web crawl to English and re-filtering them, we\nincrease the prevalence of (translated) multilingual data in the resulting\ntraining set. Pre-training on this dataset outperforms using English-only or\nEnglish-dominated datasets on ImageNet, ImageNet distribution shifts,\nimage-English-text retrieval and on average across 38 tasks from the DataComp\nbenchmark. On a geographically diverse task like GeoDE, we also observe\nimprovements across all regions, with the biggest gain coming from Africa. In\naddition, we quantitatively show that English and non-English data are\nsignificantly different in both image and (translated) text space. We hope that\nour findings motivate future work to be more intentional about including\nmulticultural and multilingual data, not just when non-English or\ngeographically diverse tasks are involved, but to enhance model capabilities at\nlarge.",

We propose a rigorous test method based on breaking down\nscenarios into simple ones, taking into account the fact that autopilots make\ndecisions according to traffic rules whose application depends on local\nknowledge and context. This leads us to consider the autopilot as a dynamic\nsystem receiving three different types of vistas as input, each characterizing\na specific driving operation and a corresponding control policy.\n  The test method for the considered vista types generates test cases for\ncritical configurations that place the vehicle under test in critical\nsituations characterized by the transition from cautious behavior to\nprogression in order to clear an obstacle. The test cases thus generated are\nrealistic, i.e., they determine the initial conditions from which safe control\npolicies are possible, based on knowledge of the vehicle's dynamic\ncharacteristics. Constraint analysis identifies the most critical test cases,\nwhose success implies the validity of less critical ones. Test coverage can\ntherefore be greatly simplified. Critical test cases reveal major defects in\nApollo, Autoware, and the Carla and LGSVL autopilots. Defects include\naccidents, software failures, and traffic rule violations that would be\ndifficult to detect by random simulation, as the test cases lead to situations\ncharacterized by finely-tuned parameters of the vehicles involved, such as\ntheir relative position and speed.\n  Our results corroborate real-life observations and confirm that autonomous\ndriving systems still have a long way to go before offering acceptable safety\nguarantees.",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the security problem for interconnected systems,\nwhere each subsystem is required to detect local attacks using locally\navailable information and the information received from its neighboring\nsubsystems. Moreover, we consider that there exists an additional eavesdropper\nbeing able to infer the private information by eavesdropping transmitted data\nbetween subsystems. Then, a privacy-preserving method is employed by adding\nprivacy noise to transmitted data, and the privacy level is measured by mutual\ninformation. Nevertheless, adding privacy noise to transmitted data may affect\nthe detection performance metrics such as detection probability and false alarm\nprobability. Thus, we theoretically analyze the trade-off between the privacy\nand the detection performance. An optimization problem with maximizing both the\ndegree of privacy preservation and the detection probability is established to\nobtain the covariance of the privacy noise. In addition, the attack detector of\neach subsystem may not obtain all information about the privacy noise. We\nfurther theoretically analyze the trade-off between the privacy and the false\nalarm probability when the attack detector has no knowledge of the privacy\nnoise covariance. An optimization problem with maximizing the degree of privacy\npreservation with guaranteeing a bound of false alarm distortion level is\nestablished to obtain {\\color{black}{the covariance of the privacy noise}}.\nMoreover, to analyze the effect of the privacy noise on the detection\nprobability, we consider that each subsystem can estimate the unknown privacy\nnoise covariance by the secondary data. Based on the estimated covariance, we\nconstruct another attack detector and analyze how the privacy noise affects its\ndetection performance. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the\neffectiveness of theoretical results.",

        "abstract": "In neuroscience, one of the key behavioral tests for determining whether a\nsubject of study exhibits model-based behavior is to study its adaptiveness to\nlocal changes in the environment. In reinforcement learning, however, recent\nstudies have shown that modern model-based agents display poor adaptivity to\nsuch changes. The main reason for this is that modern agents are typically\ndesigned to improve sample efficiency in single task settings and thus do not\ntake into account the challenges that can arise in other settings. In local\nadaptation settings, one particularly important challenge is in quickly\nbuilding and maintaining a sufficiently accurate model after a local change.\nThis is challenging for deep model-based agents as their models and replay\nbuffers are monolithic structures lacking distribution shift handling\ncapabilities. In this study, we show that the conceptually simple idea of\npartial models can allow deep model-based agents to overcome this challenge and\nthus allow for building locally adaptive model-based agents. By modeling the\ndifferent parts of the state space through different models, the agent can not\nonly maintain a model that is accurate across the state space, but it can also\nquickly adapt it in the presence of a local change in the environment. We\ndemonstrate this by showing that the use of partial models in agents such as\ndeep Dyna-Q, PlaNet and Dreamer can allow for them to effectively adapt to the\nlocal changes in their environments.",

Different from extracting dense\nmeshes from neural representation, some recent works try to model the native\nmesh distribution (i.e., a set of triangles), which generates more compact\nresults as humans crafted. However, due to the complexity and variety of mesh\ntopology, these methods are typically limited to small datasets with specific\ncategories and are hard to extend. In this paper, we introduce a generic and\nscalable mesh generation framework PivotMesh, which makes an initial attempt to\nextend the native mesh generation to large-scale datasets. We employ a\ntransformer-based auto-encoder to encode meshes into discrete tokens and decode\nthem from face level to vertex level hierarchically. Subsequently, to model the\ncomplex typology, we first learn to generate pivot vertices as coarse mesh\nrepresentation and then generate the complete mesh tokens with the same\nauto-regressive Transformer. This reduces the difficulty compared with directly\nmodeling the mesh distribution and further improves the model controllability.\nPivotMesh demonstrates its versatility by effectively learning from both small\ndatasets like Shapenet, and large-scale datasets like Objaverse and\nObjaverse-xl. Extensive experiments indicate that PivotMesh can generate\ncompact and sharp 3D meshes across various categories, highlighting its great\npotential for native mesh modeling.",

However, all the existing methods represent the\ntarget object as a closed mesh devoid of any structural information, thus\nneglecting the part-based structure, which is crucial for many downstream\napplications, of the reconstructed shape. Moreover, the generated meshes\nusually suffer from large noises, unsmooth surfaces, and blurry textures,\nmaking it challenging to obtain satisfactory part segments using 3D\nsegmentation techniques. In this paper, we present Part123, a novel framework\nfor part-aware 3D reconstruction from a single-view image. We first use\ndiffusion models to generate multiview-consistent images from a given image,\nand then leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM), which demonstrates powerful\ngeneralization ability on arbitrary objects, to generate multiview segmentation\nmasks. To effectively incorporate 2D part-based information into 3D\nreconstruction and handle inconsistency, we introduce contrastive learning into\na neural rendering framework to learn a part-aware feature space based on the\nmultiview segmentation masks. A clustering-based algorithm is also developed to\nautomatically derive 3D part segmentation results from the reconstructed\nmodels. Experiments show that our method can generate 3D models with\nhigh-quality segmented parts on various objects. Compared to existing\nunstructured reconstruction methods, the part-aware 3D models from our method\nbenefit some important applications, including feature-preserving\nreconstruction, primitive fitting, and 3D shape editing.",

When production tasks frequent changes\ndue to this demand, traditional manufacturing systems often cannot response\npromptly. The multi-agent manufacturing system is proposed to address this\nproblem. However, because of technical limitations, the negotiation among\nagents in this kind of system is realized through predefined heuristic rules,\nwhich is not intelligent enough to deal with the multi-variety and small batch\nproduction. To this end, a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) multi-agent\nmanufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor is proposed in the present\nstudy. This system delineates the diverse agents and defines their\ncollaborative methods. The roles of the agents encompass Machine Server Agent\n(MSA), Bid Inviter Agent (BIA), Bidder Agent (BA), Thinking Agent (TA), and\nDecision Agent (DA). Due to the support of LLMs, TA and DA acquire the ability\nof analyzing the shopfloor condition and choosing the most suitable machine, as\nopposed to executing a predefined program artificially. The negotiation between\nBAs and BIA is the most crucial step in connecting manufacturing resources.\nWith the support of TA and DA, BIA will finalize the distribution of orders,\nrelying on the information of each machine returned by BA. MSAs bears the\nresponsibility for connecting the agents with the physical shopfloor. This\nsystem aims to distribute and transmit workpieces through the collaboration of\nthe agents with these distinct roles, distinguishing it from other scheduling\napproaches.

However,\ncurrent VAD systems are often limited by their superficial semantic\nunderstanding of scenes and minimal user interaction. Additionally, the\nprevalent data scarcity in existing datasets restricts their applicability in\nopen-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Hawk, a novel framework that\nleverages interactive large Visual Language Models (VLM) to interpret video\nanomalies precisely. Recognizing the difference in motion information between\nabnormal and normal videos, Hawk explicitly integrates motion modality to\nenhance anomaly identification. To reinforce motion attention, we construct an\nauxiliary consistency loss within the motion and video space, guiding the video\nbranch to focus on the motion modality. Moreover, to improve the interpretation\nof motion-to-language, we establish a clear supervisory relationship between\nmotion and its linguistic representation. Furthermore, we have annotated over\n8,000 anomaly videos with language descriptions, enabling effective training\nacross diverse open-world scenarios, and also created 8,000 question-answering\npairs for users' open-world questions. The final results demonstrate that Hawk\nachieves SOTA performance, surpassing existing baselines in both video\ndescription generation and question-answering.

        "abstract": "Entity matching (EM) is a critical step in entity resolution. Recently,\nentity matching based on large language models (LLMs) has shown great promise.\nHowever, current LLM-based entity matching approaches typically follow a binary\nmatching paradigm that ignores the global consistency between different\nrecords. In this paper, we investigate various methodologies for LLM-based\nentity matching that incorporate record interactions from different\nperspectives. Specifically, we comprehensively compare three representative\nstrategies: matching, comparing, and selecting, and analyze their respective\nadvantages and challenges in diverse scenarios. Based on our findings, we\nfurther design a compositional entity matching (ComEM) framework that leverages\nthe composition of multiple strategies and LLMs. In this way, ComEM can benefit\nfrom the advantages of different sides and achieve improvements in both\neffectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results show that ComEM not only\nachieves significant performance gains on various datasets but also reduces the\ncost of LLM-based entity matching in real-world application.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth in the size of deep learning models strains the capabilities\nof traditional dense computation paradigms. Leveraging sparse computation has\nbecome increasingly popular for training and deploying large-scale models, but\nexisting deep learning frameworks lack extensive support for sparse operations.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce Scorch, a library that seamlessly integrates\nefficient sparse tensor computation into the PyTorch ecosystem, with an initial\nfocus on inference workloads on CPUs. Scorch provides a flexible and intuitive\ninterface for sparse tensors, supporting diverse sparse data structures. Scorch\nintroduces a compiler stack that automates key optimizations, including\nautomatic loop ordering, tiling, and format inference. Combined with a runtime\nthat adapts its execution to both dense and sparse data, Scorch delivers\nsubstantial speedups over hand-written PyTorch Sparse (torch.sparse) operations\nwithout sacrificing usability. More importantly, Scorch enables efficient\ncomputation of complex sparse operations that lack hand-optimized PyTorch\nimplementations. This flexibility is crucial for exploring novel sparse\narchitectures. We demonstrate Scorch's ease of use and performance gains on\ndiverse deep learning models across multiple domains. With only minimal code\nchanges, Scorch achieves 1.05-5.78x speedups over PyTorch Sparse on end-to-end\ntasks. Scorch's seamless integration and performance gains make it a valuable\naddition to the PyTorch ecosystem. We believe Scorch will enable wider\nexploration of sparsity as a tool for scaling deep learning and inform the\ndevelopment of other sparse libraries.",

        "abstract": "Feature transformation is to derive a new feature set from original features\nto augment the AI power of data. In many science domains such as material\nperformance screening, while feature transformation can model material formula\ninteractions and compositions and discover performance drivers, supervised\nlabels are collected from expensive and lengthy experiments. This issue\nmotivates an Unsupervised Feature Transformation Learning (UFTL) problem. Prior\nliterature, such as manual transformation, supervised feedback guided search,\nand PCA, either relies on domain knowledge or expensive supervised feedback, or\nsuffers from large search space, or overlooks non-linear feature-feature\ninteractions. UFTL imposes a major challenge on existing methods: how to design\na new unsupervised paradigm that captures complex feature interactions and\navoids large search space? To fill this gap, we connect graph, contrastive, and\ngenerative learning to develop a measurement-pretrain-finetune paradigm for\nUFTL. For unsupervised feature set utility measurement, we propose a feature\nvalue consistency preservation perspective and develop a mean discounted\ncumulative gain like unsupervised metric to evaluate feature set utility. For\nunsupervised feature set representation pretraining, we regard a feature set as\na feature-feature interaction graph, and develop an unsupervised graph\ncontrastive learning encoder to embed feature sets into vectors. For generative\ntransformation finetuning, we regard a feature set as a feature cross sequence\nand feature transformation as sequential generation. We develop a deep\ngenerative feature transformation model that coordinates the pretrained feature\nset encoder and the gradient information extracted from a feature set utility\nevaluator to optimize a transformed feature generator.",

Although Transformer models have dramatically shifted\nthe landscape of forecasting, their effectiveness remains debated.

In this paper, we shift focus from the overall architecture of\nthe Transformer to the effectiveness of self-attentions for time series\nforecasting. To this end, we introduce a new architecture, Cross-Attention-only\nTime Series transformer (CATS), that rethinks the traditional Transformer\nframework by eliminating self-attention and leveraging cross-attention\nmechanisms instead. By establishing future horizon-dependent parameters as\nqueries and enhanced parameter sharing, our model not only improves long-term\nforecasting accuracy but also reduces the number of parameters and memory\nusage.

Yet, the existing methods often produce stiff and unreasonable\ngestures with unseen human speech inputs due to the limited 3D speech-gesture\ndata. In this paper, we propose CoCoGesture, a novel framework enabling vivid\nand diverse gesture synthesis from unseen human speech prompts. Our key insight\nis built upon the custom-designed pretrain-fintune training paradigm. At the\npretraining stage, we aim to formulate a large generalizable gesture diffusion\nmodel by learning the abundant postures manifold. Therefore, to alleviate the\nscarcity of 3D data, we first construct a large-scale co-speech 3D gesture\ndataset containing more than 40M meshed posture instances across 4.3K speakers,\ndubbed GES-X. Then, we scale up the large unconditional diffusion model to 1B\nparameters and pre-train it to be our gesture experts. At the finetune stage,\nwe present the audio ControlNet that incorporates the human voice as condition\nprompts to guide the gesture generation. Here, we construct the audio\nControlNet through a trainable copy of our pre-trained diffusion model.\nMoreover, we design a novel Mixture-of-Gesture-Experts (MoGE) block to\nadaptively fuse the audio embedding from the human speech and the gesture\nfeatures from the pre-trained gesture experts with a routing mechanism. Such an\neffective manner ensures audio embedding is temporal coordinated with motion\nfeatures while preserving the vivid and diverse gesture generation. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our proposed CoCoGesture outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods on the zero-shot speech-to-gesture generation.

In this work, we propose a novel ContrastAlign approach that\nutilizes contrastive learning to enhance the alignment of heterogeneous\nmodalities, thereby improving the robustness of the fusion process.\nSpecifically, our approach includes the L-Instance module, which directly\noutputs LiDAR instance features within LiDAR BEV features.

We propose the\nInstanceFusion module, which utilizes contrastive learning to generate similar\ninstance features across heterogeneous modalities. We then use graph matching\nto calculate the similarity between the neighboring camera instance features\nand the similarity instance features to complete the alignment of instance\nfeatures.

        "abstract": "Collaborative perception is dedicated to tackling the constraints of\nsingle-agent perception, such as occlusions, based on the multiple agents'\nmulti-view sensor inputs. However, most existing works assume an ideal\ncondition that all agents' multi-view cameras are continuously available. In\nreality, cameras may be highly noisy, obscured or even failed during the\ncollaboration. In this work, we introduce a new robust camera-insensitivity\nproblem: how to overcome the issues caused by the failed camera perspectives,\nwhile stabilizing high collaborative performance with low calibration cost? To\naddress above problems, we propose RCDN, a Robust Camera-insensitivity\ncollaborative perception with a novel Dynamic feature-based 3D Neural modeling\nmechanism. The key intuition of RCDN is to construct collaborative neural\nrendering field representations to recover failed perceptual messages sent by\nmultiple agents. To better model collaborative neural rendering field, RCDN\nfirst establishes a geometry BEV feature based time-invariant static field with\nother agents via fast hash grid modeling. Based on the static background field,\nthe proposed time-varying dynamic field can model corresponding motion vectors\nfor foregrounds with appropriate positions. To validate RCDN, we create\nOPV2V-N, a new large-scale dataset with manual labelling under different camera\nfailed scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on OPV2V-N show that RCDN can\nbe ported to other baselines and improve their robustness in extreme\ncamera-insensitivity settings.

        "abstract": "UAV tracking and pose estimation plays an imperative role in various\nUAV-related missions, such as formation control and anti-UAV measures.\nAccurately detecting and tracking UAVs in a 3D space remains a particularly\nchallenging problem, as it requires extracting sparse features of micro UAVs\nfrom different flight environments and continuously matching correspondences,\nespecially during agile flight. Generally, cameras and LiDARs are the two main\ntypes of sensors used to capture UAV trajectories in flight. However, both\nsensors have limitations in UAV classification and pose estimation. This\ntechnical report briefly introduces the method proposed by our team \"NTU-ICG\"\nfor the CVPR 2024 UG2+ Challenge Track 5. This work develops a clustering-based\nlearning detection approach, CL-Det, for UAV tracking and pose estimation using\ntwo types of LiDARs, namely Livox Avia and LiDAR 360. We combine the\ninformation from the two data sources to locate drones in 3D. We first align\nthe timestamps of Livox Avia data and LiDAR 360 data and then separate the\npoint cloud of objects of interest (OOIs) from the environment. The point cloud\nof OOIs is clustered using the DBSCAN method, with the midpoint of the largest\ncluster assumed to be the UAV position. Furthermore, we utilize historical\nestimations to fill in missing data. The proposed method shows competitive pose\nestimation performance and ranks 5th on the final leaderboard of the CVPR 2024\nUG2+ Challenge.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an efficient algorithm for the approximation of the\nrank-one convex hull in the context of nonlinear solid mechanics. It is based\non hierarchical rank-one sequences and simultaneously provides first and second\nderivative information essential for the calculation of mechanical stresses and\nthe computational minimization of discretized energies. For materials, whose\nmicrostructure can be well approximated in terms of laminates and where each\nlaminate stage achieves energetic optimality with respect to the current stage,\nthe approximate envelope coincides with the rank-one convex envelope. Although\nthe proposed method provides only an upper bound for the rank-one convex hull,\na careful examination of the resulting constraints shows a decent applicability\nin mechanical problems. Various aspects of the algorithm are discussed,\nincluding the restoration of rotational invariance, microstructure\nreconstruction, comparisons with other semi-convexification algorithms, and\nmesh independency. Overall, this paper demonstrates the efficiency of the\nalgorithm for both, well-established mathematical benchmark problems as well as\nnonconvex isotropic finite-strain continuum damage models in two and three\ndimensions. Thereby, for the first time, a feasible concurrent numerical\nrelaxation is established for an incremental, dissipative large-strain model\nwith relevant applications in engineering problems.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the conformal isometry hypothesis as a potential\nexplanation for the emergence of hexagonal periodic patterns in the response\nmaps of grid cells. The hypothesis posits that the activities of the population\nof grid cells form a high-dimensional vector in the neural space, representing\nthe agent's self-position in 2D physical space. As the agent moves in the 2D\nphysical space, the vector rotates in a 2D manifold in the neural space, driven\nby a recurrent neural network. The conformal isometry hypothesis proposes that\nthis 2D manifold in the neural space is a conformally isometric embedding of\nthe 2D physical space, in the sense that local displacements of the vector in\nneural space are proportional to local displacements of the agent in the\nphysical space. Thus the 2D manifold forms an internal map of the 2D physical\nspace, equipped with an internal metric. In this paper, we conduct numerical\nexperiments to show that this hypothesis underlies the hexagon periodic\npatterns of grid cells. We also conduct theoretical analysis to further support\nthis hypothesis. In addition, we propose a conformal modulation of the input\nvelocity of the agent so that the recurrent neural network of grid cells\nsatisfies the conformal isometry hypothesis automatically. To summarize, our\nwork provides numerical and theoretical evidences for the conformal isometry\nhypothesis for grid cells and may serve as a foundation for further development\nof normative models of grid cells and beyond.",

We consider the Virtual Element Method (VEM) and different\nDiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, namely the Hybrid DG and Trefftz DG\nmethods. The VEM is a conforming method, that can be seen as a generalization\nof the classic finite element method to arbitrary polytopal meshes. DG methods\nare non-conforming methods that offer high flexibility, but also come with high\ncomputational costs. Hybridization reduces these costs by introducing\nadditional facet variables, onto which the computational costs can be\ntransfered to. Trefftz DG methods achieve a similar reduction in complexity by\nselecting a special and smaller set of basis functions on each element. The\nassociation of computational costs to different geometrical entities (elements\nor facets) leads to differences in the performance of these methods on\ndifferent grid types.

        "abstract": "Advancements in deep generative modeling have changed the paradigm of drug\ndiscovery. Among such approaches, target-aware methods that exploit 3D\nstructures of protein pockets were spotlighted for generating ligand molecules\nwith their plausible binding modes. While docking scores superficially assess\nthe quality of generated ligands, closer inspection of the binding structures\nreveals the inconsistency in local interactions between a pocket and generated\nligands. Here, we address the issue by explicitly generating non-covalent\ninteractions (NCIs), which are universal patterns throughout protein-ligand\ncomplexes. Our proposed model, NCIDiff, simultaneously denoises NCI types of\nprotein-ligand edges along with a 3D graph of a ligand molecule during the\nsampling. With the NCI-generating strategy, our model generates ligands with\nmore reliable NCIs, especially outperforming the baseline diffusion-based\nmodels. We further adopted inpainting techniques on NCIs to further improve the\nquality of the generated molecules. Finally, we showcase the applicability of\nNCIDiff on drug design tasks for real-world settings with specialized\nobjectives by guiding the generation process with desired NCI patterns.",

        "abstract": "Gender bias in vision-language models (VLMs) can reinforce harmful\nstereotypes and discrimination. In this paper, we focus on mitigating gender\nbias towards vision-language tasks. We identify object hallucination as the\nessence of gender bias in VLMs. Existing VLMs tend to focus on salient or\nfamiliar attributes in images but ignore contextualized nuances. Moreover, most\nVLMs rely on the co-occurrence between specific objects and gender attributes\nto infer the ignored features, ultimately resulting in gender bias. We propose\nGAMA, a task-agnostic generation framework to mitigate gender bias. GAMA\nconsists of two stages: narrative generation and answer inference. During\nnarrative generation, GAMA yields all-sided but gender-obfuscated narratives,\nwhich prevents premature concentration on localized image features, especially\ngender attributes. During answer inference, GAMA integrates the image,\ngenerated narrative, and a task-specific question prompt to infer answers for\ndifferent vision-language tasks. This approach allows the model to rethink\ngender attributes and answers. We conduct extensive experiments on GAMA,\ndemonstrating its debiasing and generalization ability.",

In this paper, we propose a\nmethod of estimating the depth of monocular panoramic image with a\nteacher-student model fusing equirectangular and spherical representations. In\ncontrast with the existing methods fusing an equirectangular representation\nwith a cube map representation or tangent representation, a spherical\nrepresentation is a better choice because a sampling on a sphere is more\nuniform and can also cope with distortion more effectively. In this processing,\na novel spherical convolution kernel computing with sampling points on a sphere\nis developed to extract features from the spherical representation, and then, a\nSegmentation Feature Fusion(SFF) methodology is utilized to combine the\nfeatures with ones extracted from the equirectangular representation. In\ncontrast with the existing methods using a teacher-student model to obtain a\nlighter model of depth estimation, we use a teacher-student model to learn the\nlatent features of depth images. This results in a trained model which\nestimates the depth map of an equirectangular image using not only the feature\nmaps extracted from an input equirectangular image but also the distilled\nknowledge learnt from the ground truth of depth map of a training set. In\nexperiments, the proposed method is tested on several well-known 360 monocular\ndepth estimation benchmark datasets, and outperforms the existing methods for\nthe most evaluation indexes.",

        "abstract": "Multi-modal object detection in autonomous driving has achieved great\nbreakthroughs due to the usage of fusing complementary information from\ndifferent sensors. The calibration in fusion between sensors such as LiDAR and\ncamera is always supposed to be precise in previous work. However, in reality,\ncalibration matrices are fixed when the vehicles leave the factory, but\nvibration, bumps, and data lags may cause calibration bias. As the research on\nthe calibration influence on fusion detection performance is relatively few,\nflexible calibration dependency multi-sensor detection method has always been\nattractive. In this paper, we conducted experiments on SOTA detection method\nEPNet++ and proved slight bias on calibration can reduce the performance\nseriously. We also proposed a re-calibration model based on semantic\nsegmentation which can be combined with a detection algorithm to improve the\nperformance and robustness of multi-modal calibration bias.",

        "abstract": "Autoregressive next-token prediction is a standard pretraining method for\nlarge-scale language models, but its application to vision tasks is hindered by\nthe non-sequential nature of image data, leading to cumulative errors. Most\nvision models employ masked autoencoder (MAE) based pretraining, which faces\nscalability issues. To address these challenges, we introduce\n\\textbf{TokenUnify}, a novel pretraining method that integrates random token\nprediction, next-token prediction, and next-all token prediction. We provide\ntheoretical evidence demonstrating that TokenUnify mitigates cumulative errors\nin visual autoregression. Cooperated with TokenUnify, we have assembled a\nlarge-scale electron microscopy (EM) image dataset with ultra-high resolution,\nideal for creating spatially correlated long sequences. This dataset includes\nover 120 million annotated voxels, making it the largest neuron segmentation\ndataset to date and providing a unified benchmark for experimental validation.\nLeveraging the Mamba network inherently suited for long-sequence modeling on\nthis dataset, TokenUnify not only reduces the computational complexity but also\nleads to a significant 45\\% improvement in segmentation performance on\ndownstream EM neuron segmentation tasks compared to existing methods.\nFurthermore, TokenUnify demonstrates superior scalability over MAE and\ntraditional autoregressive methods, effectively bridging the gap between\npretraining strategies for language and vision models.

        "abstract": "Autoregressively trained transformers have brought a profound revolution to\nthe world, especially with their in-context learning (ICL) ability to address\ndownstream tasks. Recently, several studies suggest that transformers learn a\nmesa-optimizer during autoregressive (AR) pretraining to implement ICL. Namely,\nthe forward pass of the trained transformer is equivalent to optimizing an\ninner objective function in-context. However, whether the practical non-convex\ntraining dynamics will converge to the ideal mesa-optimizer is still unclear.\nTowards filling this gap, we investigate the non-convex dynamics of a one-layer\nlinear causal self-attention model autoregressively trained by gradient flow,\nwhere the sequences are generated by an AR process $x_{t+1} = W x_t$. First,\nunder a certain condition of data distribution, we prove that an\nautoregressively trained transformer learns $W$ by implementing one step of\ngradient descent to minimize an ordinary least squares (OLS) problem\nin-context. It then applies the learned $\\widehat{W}$ for next-token\nprediction, thereby verifying the mesa-optimization hypothesis. Next, under the\nsame data conditions, we explore the capability limitations of the obtained\nmesa-optimizer. We show that a stronger assumption related to the moments of\ndata is the sufficient and necessary condition that the learned mesa-optimizer\nrecovers the distribution. Besides, we conduct exploratory analyses beyond the\nfirst data condition and prove that generally, the trained transformer will not\nperform vanilla gradient descent for the OLS problem. Finally, our simulation\nresults verify the theoretical results.",

Specifically, we examine a\ngenerative model for a target task, fine-tuned using a pre-trained model from a\nsource task. Building on the \"Shared Embedding\" concept, which bridges the\nsource and target tasks, we introduce a novel framework for transfer learning\nunder distribution metrics such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This\nframework underscores the importance of leveraging inherent similarities\nbetween diverse tasks despite their distinct data distributions. Our theory\nsuggests that the shared structures can augment the generation accuracy for a\ntarget task, reliant on the capability of a source model to identify shared\nstructures and effective knowledge transfer from source to target learning. To\ndemonstrate the practical utility of this framework, we explore the theoretical\nimplications for two specific generative models: diffusion and normalizing\nflows. The results show enhanced performance in both models over their\nnon-transfer counterparts, indicating advancements for diffusion models and\nproviding fresh insights into normalizing flows in transfer and non-transfer\nsettings.

However, fine-tuning all parameters of LLMs requires significant\nhardware resources, which can be impractical for typical users. Therefore,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning such as LoRA have emerged, allowing users to\nfine-tune LLMs without the need for considerable computing resources, with\nlittle performance degradation compared to fine-tuning all parameters.\nUnfortunately, recent studies indicate that fine-tuning can increase the risk\nto the safety of LLMs, even when data does not contain malicious content. To\naddress this challenge, we propose Safe LoRA, a simple one-liner patch to the\noriginal LoRA implementation by introducing the projection of LoRA weights from\nselected layers to the safety-aligned subspace, effectively reducing the safety\nrisks in LLM fine-tuning while maintaining utility. It is worth noting that\nSafe LoRA is a training-free and data-free approach, as it only requires the\nknowledge of the weights from the base and aligned LLMs. Our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that when fine-tuning on purely malicious data, Safe\nLoRA retains similar safety performance as the original aligned model.\nMoreover, when the fine-tuning dataset contains a mixture of both benign and\nmalicious data, Safe LoRA mitigates the negative effect made by malicious data\nwhile preserving performance on downstream tasks.",

We\neffectively initialize these pyramidal Gaussians through sampling a rapidly\ntrained grid-based NeRF at various frequencies.

        "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of generative AI has raised questions about the\ncompetitiveness of lower-parameter, locally tunable, open-weight models\nrelative to high-parameter, API-guarded, closed-weight models in terms of\nperformance, domain adaptation, cost, and generalization. Centering\nunder-resourced yet risk-intolerant settings in government, research, and\nhealthcare, we see for-profit closed-weight models as incompatible with\nrequirements for transparency, privacy, adaptability, and standards of\nevidence. Yet the performance penalty in using open-weight models, especially\nin low-data and low-resource settings, is unclear.\n  We assess the feasibility of using smaller, open-weight models to replace\nGPT-4-Turbo in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned regimes, assuming access to\nonly a single, low-cost GPU. We assess value-sensitive issues around bias,\nprivacy, and abstention on three additional tasks relevant to those topics. We\nfind that with relatively low effort, very low absolute monetary cost, and\nrelatively little data for fine-tuning, small open-weight models can achieve\ncompetitive performance in domain-adapted tasks without sacrificing generality.\nWe then run experiments considering practical issues in bias, privacy, and\nhallucination risk, finding that open models offer several benefits over closed\nmodels. We intend this work as a case study in understanding the opportunity\ncost of reproducibility and transparency over for-profit state-of-the-art zero\nshot performance, finding this cost to be marginal under realistic settings.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, neural network-driven image compression (NIC) has gained\nsignificant attention. Some works adopt deep generative models such as GANs and\ndiffusion models to enhance perceptual quality (realism). A critical obstacle\nof these generative NIC methods is that each model is optimized for a single\nbit rate. Consequently, multiple models are required to compress images to\ndifferent bit rates, which is impractical for real-world applications. To\ntackle this issue, we propose a variable-rate generative NIC model.\nSpecifically, we explore several discriminator designs tailored for the\nvariable-rate approach and introduce a novel adversarial loss. Moreover, by\nincorporating the newly proposed multi-realism technique, our method allows the\nusers to adjust the bit rate, distortion, and realism with a single model,\nachieving ultra-controllability. Unlike existing variable-rate generative NIC\nmodels, our method matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art\nsingle-rate generative NIC models while covering a wide range of bit rates\nusing just one model.

        "abstract": "Accurate retinal vessel segmentation is a crucial step in the quantitative\nassessment of retinal vasculature, which is needed for the early detection of\nretinal diseases and other conditions. Numerous studies have been conducted to\ntackle the problem of segmenting vessels automatically using a pixel-wise\nclassification approach. The common practice of creating ground truth labels is\nto categorize pixels as foreground and background. This approach is, however,\nbiased, and it ignores the uncertainty of a human annotator when it comes to\nannotating e.g. thin vessels. In this work, we propose a simple and effective\nmethod that casts the retinal image segmentation task as an image-level\nregression. For this purpose, we first introduce a novel Segmentation\nAnnotation Uncertainty-Aware (SAUNA) transform, which adds pixel uncertainty to\nthe ground truth using the pixel's closeness to the annotation boundary and\nvessel thickness. To train our model with soft labels, we generalize the\nearlier proposed Jaccard metric loss to arbitrary hypercubes, which is a second\ncontribution of this work. The proposed SAUNA transform and the new theoretical\nresults allow us to directly train a standard U-Net-like architecture at the\nimage level, outperforming all recently published methods. We conduct thorough\nexperiments and compare our method to a diverse set of baselines across 5\nretinal image datasets.

        "abstract": "One of the primary challenges in brain tumor segmentation arises from the\nuncertainty of voxels close to tumor boundaries. However, the conventional\nprocess of generating ground truth segmentation masks fails to treat such\nuncertainties properly. Those ``hard labels'' with 0s and 1s conceptually\ninfluenced the majority of prior studies on brain image segmentation. As a\nresult, tumor segmentation is often solved through voxel classification. In\nthis work, we instead view this problem as a voxel-level regression, where the\nground truth represents a certainty mapping from any pixel based on the\ndistance to tumor border. We propose a novel ground truth label transformation,\nwhich is based on a signed geodesic transform, to capture the uncertainty in\nbrain tumors' vicinity, while maintaining a margin between positive and\nnegative samples. We combine this idea with a Focal-like regression L1-loss\nthat enables effective regression learning in high-dimensional output space by\nappropriately weighting voxels according to their difficulty. We thoroughly\nconduct an experimental evaluation to validate the components of our proposed\nmethod, compare it to a diverse array of state-of-the-art segmentation models,\nand show that it is architecture-agnostic.

        "abstract": "We consider offline reinforcement learning (RL) in $H$-horizon Markov\ndecision processes (MDPs) under the linear $q^\\pi$-realizability assumption,\nwhere the action-value function of every policy is linear with respect to a\ngiven $d$-dimensional feature function. The hope in this setting is that\nlearning a good policy will be possible without requiring a sample size that\nscales with the number of states in the MDP. Foster et al. [2021] have shown\nthis to be impossible even under $\\textit{concentrability}$, a data coverage\nassumption where a coefficient $C_\\text{conc}$ bounds the extent to which the\nstate-action distribution of any policy can veer off the data distribution.\nHowever, the data in this previous work was in the form of a sequence of\nindividual transitions. This leaves open the question of whether the negative\nresult mentioned could be overcome if the data was composed of sequences of\nfull trajectories. In this work we answer this question positively by proving\nthat with trajectory data, a dataset of size\n$\\text{poly}(d,H,C_\\text{conc})/\\epsilon^2$ is sufficient for deriving an\n$\\epsilon$-optimal policy, regardless of the size of the state space. The main\ntool that makes this result possible is due to Weisz et al. [2023], who\ndemonstrate that linear MDPs can be used to approximate linearly\n$q^\\pi$-realizable MDPs. The connection to trajectory data is that the linear\nMDP approximation relies on \"skipping\" over certain states. The associated\nestimation problems are thus easy when working with trajectory data, while they\nremain nontrivial when working with individual transitions. The question of\ncomputational efficiency under our assumptions remains open.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge tracing has been widely used in online learning systems to guide\nthe students' future learning. However, most existing KT models primarily focus\non extracting abundant information from the question sets and explore the\nrelationships between them, but ignore the personalized student behavioral\ninformation in the learning process. This will limit the model's ability to\naccurately capture the personalized knowledge states of students and reasonably\npredict their performances. To alleviate this limitation, we explicitly models\nthe personalized learning process by incorporating the emotions, a\nrepresentative personalized behavior in the learning process, into KT\nframework. Specifically, we present a novel Dual-State Personalized Knowledge\nTracing with Emotional Incorporation model to achieve this goal: Firstly, we\nincorporate emotional information into the modeling process of knowledge state,\nresulting in the Knowledge State Boosting Module. Secondly, we design an\nEmotional State Tracing Module to monitor students' personalized emotional\nstates, and propose an emotion prediction method based on personalized\nemotional states. Finally, we apply the predicted emotions to enhance students'\nresponse prediction. Furthermore, to extend the generalization capability of\nour model across different datasets, we design a transferred version of DEKT,\nnamed Transfer Learning-based Self-loop model (T-DEKT). Extensive experiments\nshow our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",

        "abstract": "In education data mining (EDM) communities, machine learning has achieved\nremarkable success in discovering patterns and structures to tackle educational\nchallenges. Notably, fairness and algorithmic bias have gained attention in\nlearning analytics of EDM. With the increasing demand for the right to be\nforgotten, there is a growing need for machine learning models to forget\nsensitive data and its impact, particularly within the realm of EDM. The\nparadigm of selective forgetting, also known as machine unlearning, has been\nextensively studied to address this need by eliminating the influence of\nspecific data from a pre-trained model without complete retraining. However,\nexisting research assumes that interactive data removal operations are\nconducted in secure and reliable environments, neglecting potential malicious\nunlearning requests to undermine the fairness of machine learning systems. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel class of selective forgetting attacks designed\nto compromise the fairness of learning models while maintaining their\npredictive accuracy, thereby preventing the model owner from detecting the\ndegradation in model performance. Additionally, we propose an innovative\noptimization framework for selective forgetting attacks, capable of generating\nmalicious unlearning requests across various attack scenarios. We validate the\neffectiveness of our proposed selective forgetting attacks on fairness through\nextensive experiments using diverse EDM datasets.",

This problem is particularly\nimportant for analyzing shape-focused real-world scientific image datasets,\ngiven their significant relevance to downstream tasks. The existing works\naddress the problem by explicitly parameterizing the transformation factors,\nsignificantly reducing their expressiveness. Moreover, they are not applicable\nin cases where transformations can not be readily parametrized. An alternative\nto such explicit approaches is self-supervised methods with data augmentation,\nwhich implicitly disentangles transformations and content. We demonstrate that\nthe existing self-supervised methods with data augmentation result in the poor\ndisentanglement of content and transformations in real-world scenarios.\nTherefore, we developed a novel self-supervised method, DualContrast,\nspecifically for unsupervised disentanglement of content and transformations in\nshape-focused image datasets. Our extensive experiments showcase the\nsuperiority of DualContrast over existing self-supervised and explicit\nparameterization approaches. We leveraged DualContrast to disentangle protein\nidentities and protein conformations in cellular 3D protein images.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a cooperative sensing framework in the context of\nfuture multi-functional network with both communication and sensing ability,\nwhere one base station (BS) serves as a sensing transmitter and several nearby\nBSs serve as sensing receivers. Each receiver receives the sensing signal\nreflected by the target and communicates with the fusion center (FC) through a\nwireless multiple access channel (MAC) for cooperative target localization. To\nimprove the localization performance, we present a hybrid information-signal\ndomain cooperative sensing (HISDCS) design, where each sensing receiver\ntransmits both the estimated time delay/effective reflecting coefficient and\nthe received sensing signal sampled around the estimated time delay to the FC.\nThen, we propose to minimize the number of channel uses by utilizing an\nefficient Karhunen-Lo\\'eve transformation (KLT) encoding scheme for signal\nquantization and proper node selection, under the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound\n(CRLB) constraint and the capacity limits of MAC. A novel matrix-inequality\nconstrained successive convex approximation (MCSCA) algorithm is proposed to\noptimize the wireless backhaul resource allocation, together with a greedy\nstrategy for node selection. Despite the high non-convexness of the considered\nproblem, we prove that the proposed MCSCA algorithm is able to converge to the\nset of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solutions of a relaxed problem obtained by\nrelaxing the discrete variables. Besides, a low-complexity quantization bit\nreallocation algorithm is designed, which does not perform explicit node\nselection, and is able to harvest most of the performance gain brought by\nHISDCS. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to show that the proposed\nHISDCS design is able to significantly outperform the baseline schemes.",

However, there are few works utilizing LLMs to assist multimodal\nrepresentation tasks. In this work, we investigate the potential of LLMs to\nenhance multimodal representation in multimodal item-to-item (I2I)\nrecommendations. One feasible method is the transfer of Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs) for representation tasks. However, pre-training MLLMs\nusually requires collecting high-quality, web-scale multimodal data, resulting\nin complex training procedures and high costs. This leads the community to rely\nheavily on open-source MLLMs, hindering customized training for representation\nscenarios. Therefore, we aim to design an end-to-end training method that\ncustomizes the integration of any existing LLMs and vision encoders to\nconstruct efficient multimodal representation models. Preliminary experiments\nshow that fine-tuned LLMs in this end-to-end method tend to overlook image\ncontent. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel training framework,\nNoteLLM-2, specifically designed for multimodal representation. We propose two\nways to enhance the focus on visual information. The first method is based on\nthe prompt viewpoint, which separates multimodal content into visual content\nand textual content. NoteLLM-2 adopts the multimodal In-Content Learning method\nto teach LLMs to focus on both modalities and aggregate key information. The\nsecond method is from the model architecture, utilizing a late fusion mechanism\nto directly fuse visual information into textual information.

        "abstract": "One key challenge in backdoor attacks against large foundation models is the\nresource limits. Backdoor attacks usually require retraining the target model,\nwhich is impractical for very large foundation models. Existing backdoor\nattacks are mainly designed for supervised classifiers or small foundation\nmodels (e.g., BERT). None of these attacks has successfully compromised a very\nlarge foundation model, such as Llama-3-70B, especially with limited\ncomputational resources. In this paper, we propose TrojFM, a novel backdoor\nattack tailored for very large foundation models. Our primary technical\ncontribution is the development of a novel backdoor injection method. This\nmethod forces a backdoored model to generate similar hidden representations for\npoisoned inputs regardless of their actual semantics. Our approach injects such\nbackdoors by fine-tuning only a very small proportion of model parameters. This\nenables TrojFM to efficiently launch downstream task-agnostic backdoor attacks\nagainst very large foundation models under limited computational resources.\nMoreover, we optimize the fine-tuning process with our customized QLoRA\ntechnique, enabling launching our attack via only~\\textit{one A100 GPU}.\nFurthermore, we design a new trigger injection method to ensure our attack\nstealthiness. Through extensive experiments, we first demonstrate that TrojFM\ncan launch effective backdoor attacks against widely used large GPT-style\nmodels without jeopardizing their normal functionalities (and outperforming\nexisting attacks on BERT-style models). Furthermore, we show that TrojFM is\nresilient to SOTA defenses and is insensitive to changes in key\nhyper-parameters. Finally, we conduct a resource analysis to quantify that our\nmethod can significantly save computational and memory costs compared to\nexisting backdoor attacks.",

        "abstract": "Social recommendation models weave social interactions into their design to\nprovide uniquely personalized recommendation results for users. However, social\nnetworks not only amplify the popularity bias in recommendation models,\nresulting in more frequent recommendation of hot items and fewer long-tail\nitems, but also include a substantial amount of redundant information that is\nessentially meaningless for the model's performance. Existing social\nrecommendation models fail to address the issues of popularity bias and the\nredundancy of social information, as they directly characterize social\ninfluence across the entire social network without making targeted adjustments.\nIn this paper, we propose a Condition-Guided Social Recommendation Model (named\nCGSoRec) to mitigate the model's popularity bias by denoising the social\nnetwork and adjusting the weights of user's social preferences. More\nspecifically, CGSoRec first includes a Condition-Guided Social Denoising Model\n(CSD) to remove redundant social relations in the social network for capturing\nusers' social preferences with items more precisely. Then, CGSoRec calculates\nusers' social preferences based on denoised social network and adjusts the\nweights in users' social preferences to make them can counteract the popularity\nbias present in the recommendation model. At last, CGSoRec includes a\nCondition-Guided Diffusion Recommendation Model (CGD) to introduce the adjusted\nsocial preferences as conditions to control the recommendation results for a\ndebiased direction. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is in:\nhttps://github.com/hexin5515/CGSoRec.",

        "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify abnormal nodes that\ndiffer from the majority within a graph, has garnered significant attention.\nHowever, current GAD methods necessitate training specific to each dataset,\nresulting in high training costs, substantial data requirements, and limited\ngeneralizability when being applied to new datasets and domains. To address\nthese limitations, this paper proposes ARC, a generalist GAD approach that\nenables a ``one-for-all'' GAD model to detect anomalies across various graph\ndatasets on-the-fly. Equipped with in-context learning, ARC can directly\nextract dataset-specific patterns from the target dataset using few-shot normal\nsamples at the inference stage, without the need for retraining or fine-tuning\non the target dataset. ARC comprises three components that are well-crafted for\ncapturing universal graph anomaly patterns: 1) smoothness-based feature\nAlignment module that unifies the features of different datasets into a common\nand anomaly-sensitive space; 2) ego-neighbor Residual graph encoder that learns\nabnormality-related node embeddings; and 3) cross-attentive in-Context anomaly\nscoring module that predicts node abnormality by leveraging few-shot normal\nsamples. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets from various\ndomains demonstrate the superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and\ngeneralizability of ARC.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of graphical processing units, Physics-Informed\nNeural Networks (PINNs) are emerging as a promising tool for solving partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs). However, PINNs are not well suited for solving\nPDEs with multiscale features, particularly suffering from slow convergence and\npoor accuracy. To address this limitation of PINNs, this article proposes\nphysics-informed cell representations for resolving multiscale Poisson problems\nusing a model architecture consisting of multilevel multiresolution grids\ncoupled with a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The grid parameters (i.e., the\nlevel-dependent feature vectors) and the MLP parameters (i.e., the weights and\nbiases) are determined using gradient-descent based optimization. The\nvariational (weak) form based loss function accelerates computation by allowing\nthe linear interpolation of feature vectors within grid cells. This cell-based\nMLP model also facilitates the use of a decoupled training scheme for Dirichlet\nboundary conditions and a parameter-sharing scheme for periodic boundary\nconditions, delivering superior accuracy compared to conventional PINNs.\nFurthermore, the numerical examples highlight improved speed and accuracy in\nsolving PDEs with nonlinear or high-frequency boundary conditions and provide\ninsights into hyperparameter selection. In essence, by cell-based MLP model\nalong with the parallel tiny-cuda-nn library, our implementation improves\nconvergence speed and numerical accuracy.",

Such subsets also have a natural algebraic structure\nincluding operations (e.g., union) and corresponding laws (e.g.,\nassociativity). How can we learn to \"union\" two sets using only their latent\nembeddings while respecting associativity? We propose a general procedure for\nparameterizing latent space operations that are provably consistent with the\nlaws on the input space. This is achieved by learning a bijection from the\nlatent space to a carefully designed mirrored algebra which is constructed on\nEuclidean space in accordance with desired laws. We evaluate these structural\ntransport nets for a range of mirrored algebras against baselines that operate\ndirectly on the latent space.

Then,\nwe incorporate a multi-layer convolutional network as a discriminative reformer\nand learn it to convert the category-aware descriptors into identity-aware\nvectors, where the learning is effectively supervised by distilling relation\nknowledge from off-the-shelf face recognition model. In this way, the\ndiscriminative reformer together with the generative encoder serves as the\npretrained backbone, providing general and discriminative representations\ntowards masked faces.

        "abstract": "As the rapidly developments of artificial intelligence and machine learning,\nbehavior tree design in multiagent system or AI game become more important. The\nbehavior tree design problem is highly related to the source coding in\ninformation theory. \"Twenty Questions\" problem is a typical example for the\nbehavior tree design, usually used to explain the source coding application in\ninformation theory and can be solved by Huffman coding. In some realistic\nscenarios, there are some constraints on the asked questions. However, for\ngeneral question set, finding the minimum expected querying length is an open\nproblem, belongs to NP-hard. Recently, a new coding scheme has been proposed to\nprovide a near optimal solution for binary cases with some constraints, named\ngreedy binary separation coding (GBSC). In this work, we shall generalize it to\nD-ary cases and propose maximum information gain coding (MIGC) approach to\nsolve the multi-answer decision constrained querying problem. The optimality of\nthe proposed MIGC is discussed in theory. Later on, we also apply MIGC to\ndiscuss three practical scenarios and showcase that MIGC has better performance\nthan GBSC and Shannon Coding in terms of bits persymbol.",

        "abstract": "There is a long history in machine learning of model ensembling, beginning\nwith boosting and bagging and continuing to the present day. Much of this\nhistory has focused on combining models for classification and regression, but\nrecently there is interest in more complex settings such as ensembling policies\nin reinforcement learning. Strong connections have also emerged between\nensembling and multicalibration techniques. In this work, we further\ninvestigate these themes by considering a setting in which we wish to ensemble\nmodels for multidimensional output predictions that are in turn used for\ndownstream optimization. More precisely, we imagine we are given a number of\nmodels mapping a state space to multidimensional real-valued predictions. These\npredictions form the coefficients of a linear objective that we would like to\noptimize under specified constraints. The fundamental question we address is\nhow to improve and combine such models in a way that outperforms the best of\nthem in the downstream optimization problem. We apply multicalibration\ntechniques that lead to two provably efficient and convergent algorithms. The\nfirst of these (the white box approach) requires being given models that map\nstates to output predictions, while the second (the \\emph{black box} approach)\nrequires only policies (mappings from states to solutions to the optimization\nproblem). For both, we provide convergence and utility guarantees. We conclude\nby investigating the performance and behavior of the two algorithms in a\ncontrolled experimental setting.",

        "abstract": "We address the challenge of multi-agent cooperation, where agents achieve a\ncommon goal by interacting with a 3D scene and cooperating with decentralized\nagents under complex partial observations. This involves managing communication\ncosts and optimizing interaction trajectories in dynamic environments. Our\nresearch focuses on three primary limitations of existing cooperative agent\nsystems. Firstly, current systems demonstrate inefficiency in managing acquired\ninformation through observation, resulting in declining planning performance as\nthe environment becomes more complex with additional objects or goals.\nSecondly, the neglect of false plans in partially observable settings leads to\nsuboptimal cooperative performance, as agents struggle to adapt to\nenvironmental changes influenced by the unseen actions of other agents. Lastly,\nthe failure to incorporate spatial data into decision-making processes\nrestricts the agent's ability to construct optimized trajectories. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose the RElevance and Validation-Enhanced Cooperative\nLanguage Agent (REVECA), a novel cognitive architecture powered by GPT-3.5.\nREVECA leverages relevance assessment, plan validation, and spatial information\nto enhance the efficiency and robustness of agent cooperation in dynamic and\npartially observable environments while minimizing continuous communication\ncosts and effectively managing irrelevant dummy objects. Our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of REVECA over previous approaches,\nincluding those driven by GPT-4.0.

This\nsuccess is largely attributed to the preservation of pre-trained features,\nachieved through a near-optimal linear head obtained during LP. However,\ndespite the widespread use of large language models, the exploration of complex\narchitectures such as Transformers remains limited. In this paper, we analyze\nthe training dynamics of LP-FT for classification models on the basis of the\nneural tangent kernel (NTK) theory. Our analysis decomposes the NTK matrix into\ntwo components, highlighting the importance of the linear head norm alongside\nthe prediction accuracy at the start of the FT stage. We also observe a\nsignificant increase in the linear head norm during LP, stemming from training\nwith the cross-entropy (CE) loss, which effectively minimizes feature changes.\nFurthermore, we find that this increased norm can adversely affect model\ncalibration, a challenge that can be addressed by temperature scaling.\nAdditionally, we extend our analysis with the NTK to the low-rank adaptation\n(LoRA) method and validate its effectiveness. Our experiments with a\nTransformer-based model on natural language processing tasks across multiple\nbenchmarks confirm our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness\nof LP-FT in fine-tuning language models.

Utilizing Hugging Face -- the\npremier hub for transformer-based models -- as our primary source, we curate a\nlist of datasets and models that are manually confirmed to be relevant to\nsoftware engineering. By analyzing the ecosystem, we first identify the popular\nand influential datasets, models, and contributors. The popularity is\nquantified by various metrics, including the number of downloads, the number of\nlikes, the number of reuses, etc. The ecosystem follows a power-law\ndistribution, indicating that users prefer widely recognized models and\ndatasets. Then, we manually categorize how models in the ecosystem are reused\ninto nine categories, analyzing prevalent model reuse practices. The top 3 most\npopular reuse types are fine-tuning, architecture sharing, and quantization. We\nalso explore the practices surrounding the publication of LLM4Code,\nspecifically focusing on documentation practice and license selection.

        "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM), originally designed for general-purpose\nsegmentation tasks, has been used recently for polyp segmentation. Nonetheless,\nfine-tuning SAM with data from new imaging centers or clinics poses significant\nchallenges. This is because this necessitates the creation of an expensive and\ntime-intensive annotated dataset, along with the potential for variability in\nuser prompts during inference. To address these issues, we propose a robust\nfine-tuning technique, PP-SAM, that allows SAM to adapt to the polyp\nsegmentation task with limited images. To this end, we utilize variable\nperturbed bounding box prompts (BBP) to enrich the learning context and enhance\nthe model's robustness to BBP perturbations during inference. Rigorous\nexperiments on polyp segmentation benchmarks reveal that our variable BBP\nperturbation significantly improves model resilience. Notably, on Kvasir,\n1-shot fine-tuning boosts the DICE score by 20% and 37% with 50 and 100-pixel\nBBP perturbations during inference, respectively. Moreover, our experiments\nshow that 1-shot, 5-shot, and 10-shot PP-SAM with 50-pixel perturbations during\ninference outperform a recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) polyp segmentation method\nby 26%, 7%, and 5% DICE scores, respectively. Our results motivate the broader\napplicability of our PP-SAM for other medical imaging tasks with limited\nsamples. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/SLDGroup/PP-SAM.",

As a result, a\nnetwork with pre-aligned weights learns notably faster than a network without\nrandom noise training, even reaching a convergence speed comparable to that of\na backpropagation algorithm. Sequential training with both random noise and\ndata brings weights closer to synaptic feedback than training solely with data,\nenabling more precise credit assignment and faster learning. We also found that\neach readout probability approaches the chance level and that the effective\ndimensionality of weights decreases in a network pretrained with random noise.\nThis pre-regularization allows the network to learn simple solutions of a low\nrank, reducing the generalization loss during subsequent training. This also\nenables the network robustly to generalize a novel, out-of-distribution\ndataset. Lastly, we confirmed that random noise pretraining reduces the amount\nof meta-loss, enhancing the network ability to adapt to various tasks. Overall,\nour results suggest that random noise training with feedback alignment offers a\nstraightforward yet effective method of pretraining that facilitates quick and\nreliable learning without weight transport.",

        "abstract": "Offline Black-Box Optimization (BBO) aims at optimizing a black-box function\nusing the knowledge from a pre-collected offline dataset of function values and\ncorresponding input designs. However, the high-dimensional and\nhighly-multimodal input design space of black-box function pose inherent\nchallenges for most existing methods that model and operate directly upon input\ndesigns. These issues include but are not limited to high sample complexity,\nwhich relates to inaccurate approximation of black-box function; and\ninsufficient coverage and exploration of input design modes, which leads to\nsuboptimal proposal of new input designs. In this work, we consider finding a\nlatent space that serves as a compressed yet accurate representation of the\ndesign-value joint space, enabling effective latent exploration of high-value\ninput design modes. To this end, we formulate an learnable energy-based latent\nspace, and propose Noise-intensified Telescoping density-Ratio Estimation\n(NTRE) scheme for variational learning of an accurate latent space model\nwithout costly Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The optimization process is then\nexploration of high-value designs guided by the learned energy-based model in\nthe latent space, formulated as gradient-based sampling from a\nlatent-variable-parameterized inverse model. We show that our particular\nparameterization encourages expanded exploration around high-value design\nmodes, motivated by inversion thinking of a fundamental result of conditional\ncovariance matrix typically used for variance reduction. We observe that our\nmethod, backed by an accurately learned informative latent space and an\nexpanding-exploration model design, yields significant improvements over strong\nprevious methods on both synthetic and real world datasets such as the\ndesign-bench suite.",
