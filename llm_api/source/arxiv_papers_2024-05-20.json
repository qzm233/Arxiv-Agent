        "abstract": "Traditional 3D garment creation is labor-intensive, involving sketching,\nmodeling, UV mapping, and texturing, which are time-consuming and costly.\nRecent advances in diffusion-based generative models have enabled new\npossibilities for 3D garment generation from text prompts, images, and videos.\nHowever, existing methods either suffer from inconsistencies among multi-view\nimages or require additional processes to separate cloth from the underlying\nhuman model. In this paper, we propose GarmentDreamer, a novel method that\nleverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as guidance to generate wearable,\nsimulation-ready 3D garment meshes from text prompts. In contrast to using\nmulti-view images directly predicted by generative models as guidance, our 3DGS\nguidance ensures consistent optimization in both garment deformation and\ntexture synthesis. Our method introduces a novel garment augmentation module,\nguided by normal and RGBA information, and employs implicit Neural Texture\nFields (NeTF) combined with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to generate\ndiverse geometric and texture details. We validate the effectiveness of our\napproach through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments,\nshowcasing the superior performance of GarmentDreamer over state-of-the-art\nalternatives.

Unlike\nthe conventional method of random masking, our technique utilizes a\nteacher-student model to focus on intricate areas within the data, guiding the\nmodel's focus toward regions with higher geometric complexity. This strategy is\ngrounded in the hypothesis that concentrating on harder patches yields a more\nrobust feature representation, as evidenced by the improved performance on\ndownstream tasks. Our method also presents a complete-to-partial feature-level\nknowledge distillation technique designed to guide the prediction of geometric\ncomplexity utilizing a comprehensive context from feature-level information.\nExtensive experiments confirm our method's superiority over State-Of-The-Art\n(SOTA) baselines, demonstrating marked improvements in classification, and\nfew-shot tasks.",

        "abstract": "Ensemble systems appear frequently in many engineering applications and, as a\nresult, they have become an important research topic in control theory. These\nsystems are best characterized by the evolution of their underlying state\ndistribution. Despite the work to date, few results exist dealing with the\nproblem of directly modifying (i.e., \"steering\") the distribution of an\nensemble system. In addition, in most of the existing results, the distribution\nof the states of an ensemble of discrete-time systems is assumed to be\nGaussian. However, in case the system parameters are uncertain, it is not\nalways realistic to assume that the distribution of the system follows a\nGaussian distribution, thus complicating the solution of the overall problem.\nIn this paper, we address the general distribution steering problem for\nfirst-order discrete-time ensemble systems, where the distributions of the\nsystem parameters and the states are arbitrary with finite first few moments.\nBoth linear and nonlinear system dynamics are considered using the method of\npower moments to transform the original infinite-dimensional problem into a\nfinite-dimensional one. We also propose a control law for the ensuing moment\nsystem, which allows us to obtain the power moments of the desired control\ninputs. Finally, we solve the inverse problem to obtain the feasible control\ninputs from their corresponding power moments. We provide numerical results to\nvalidate our theoretical developments. These include cases where the parameter\ndistribution is uniform, Gaussian, non-Gaussian, and multi-modal, respectively.",

        "abstract": "In economies without monetary transfers, token systems serve as an\nalternative to sustain cooperation, alleviate free riding, and increase\nefficiency. This paper studies whether a token-based economy can be effective\nin marketplaces with thin exogenous supply. We consider a marketplace in which\nat each time period one agent requests a service, one agent provides the\nservice, and one token (artificial currency) is used to pay for service\nprovision. The number of tokens each agent has represents the difference\nbetween the amount of service provisions and service requests by the agent. We\nare interested in the behavior of this economy when very few agents are\navailable to provide the requested service. Since balancing the number of\ntokens across agents is key to sustain cooperation, the agent with the minimum\namount of tokens is selected to provide service among the available agents.\nWhen exactly one random agent is available to provide service, we show that the\ntoken distribution is unstable. However, already when just two random agents\nare available to provide service, the token distribution is stable, in the\nsense that agents' token balance is unlikely to deviate much from their initial\nendowment, and agents return to their initial endowment in finite expected\ntime. Our results mirror the power of two choices paradigm in load balancing\nproblems. Supported by numerical simulations using kidney exchange data, our\nfindings suggest that token systems may generate efficient outcomes in kidney\nexchange marketplaces by sustaining cooperation between hospitals.",

However, there is evidence that low-resource\nlanguages can benefit from targeted multilinguality, where the model is trained\non closely related languages. To test this approach more rigorously, we\nsystematically study best practices for adapting a pre-trained model to a\nlanguage family. Focusing on the Uralic family as a test case, we adapt XLM-R\nunder various configurations to model 15 languages; we then evaluate the\nperformance of each experimental setting on two downstream tasks and 11\nevaluation languages. Our adapted models significantly outperform mono- and\nmultilingual baselines. Furthermore, a regression analysis of hyperparameter\neffects reveals that adapted vocabulary size is relatively unimportant for\nlow-resource languages, and that low-resource languages can be aggressively\nup-sampled during training at little detriment to performance in high-resource\nlanguages. These results introduce new best practices for performing language\nadaptation in a targeted setting.",

But this does not mean that local search algorithms will\nalways find and follow such short ascents in sparse VCSPs. I show that with\nloglog treedepth, superpolynomial ascents exist; and for polylog treedepth,\nthere are initial assignments from which all ascents are superpolynomial.\nTogether, these results suggest that the study of sparse VCSPs can help us\nbetter understand the barriers to efficient local search.",

        "abstract": "A flexible active safety motion (FASM) control approach is proposed for the\navoidance of dynamic obstacles and the reference tracking in robot\nmanipulators. The distinctive feature of the proposed method lies in its\nutilization of control barrier functions (CBF) to design flexible CBF-guided\nsafety criteria (CBFSC) with dynamically optimized decay rates, thereby\noffering flexibility and active safety for robot manipulators in dynamic\nenvironments. First, discrete-time CBFs are employed to formulate the novel\nflexible CBFSC with dynamic decay rates for robot manipulators. Following that,\nthe model predictive control (MPC) philosophy is applied, integrating flexible\nCBFSC as safety constraints into the receding-horizon optimization problem.\nSignificantly, the decay rates of the designed CBFSC are incorporated as\ndecision variables in the optimization problem, facilitating the dynamic\nenhancement of flexibility during the obstacle avoidance process. In\nparticular, a novel cost function that integrates a penalty term is designed to\ndynamically adjust the safety margins of the CBFSC. Finally, experiments are\nconducted in various scenarios using a Universal Robots 5 (UR5) manipulator to\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneous datasets emerge in various machine learning or optimization\napplications that feature different data sources, various data types and\ncomplex relationships between variables. In practice, heterogeneous datasets\nare often partitioned into smaller well-behaved ones that are easier to\nprocess. However, some applications involve expensive-to-generate or limited\nsize datasets, which motivates methods based on the whole dataset. The first\nmain contribution of this work is a modeling graph-structured framework that\ngeneralizes state-of-the-art hierarchical, tree-structured, or variable-size\nframeworks. This framework models domains that involve heterogeneous datasets\nin which variables may be continuous, integer, or categorical, with some\nidentified as meta if their values determine the inclusion/exclusion or affect\nthe bounds of other so-called decreed variables. Excluded variables are\nintroduced to manage variables that are either included or excluded depending\non the given points. The second main contribution is the graph-structured\ndistance that compares extended points with any combination of included and\nexcluded variables: any pair of points can be compared, allowing to work\ndirectly in heterogeneous datasets with meta variables.

This is particularly critical in use cases where inference\nthroughput is greatly limited by hardware constraints. To this end, we propose\nthe Activation-Sharing Multi-Resolution (ASMR) coordinate network that combines\nmulti-resolution coordinate decomposition with hierarchical modulations.\nSpecifically, an ASMR model enables the sharing of activations across grids of\nthe data. This largely decouples its inference cost from its depth which is\ndirectly correlated to its reconstruction capability, and renders a near O(1)\ninference complexity irrespective of the number of layers.

Predicting potential outcomes along with\nits uncertainty in a counterfactual world poses the foundamental challenge in\ncausal inference. Existing methods that construct confidence intervals for\ncounterfactuals either rely on the assumption of strong ignorability, or need\naccess to un-identifiable lower and upper bounds that characterize the\ndifference between observational and interventional distributions. To overcome\nthese limitations, we first propose a novel approach wTCP-DR based on\ntransductive weighted conformal prediction, which provides confidence intervals\nfor counterfactual outcomes with marginal converage guarantees, even under\nhidden confounding. With less restrictive assumptions, our approach requires\naccess to a fraction of interventional data (from randomized controlled trials)\nto account for the covariate shift from observational distributoin to\ninterventional distribution. Theoretical results explicitly demonstrate the\nconditions under which our algorithm is strictly advantageous to the naive\nmethod that only uses interventional data. After ensuring valid intervals on\ncounterfactuals, it is straightforward to construct intervals for individual\ntreatment effects (ITEs).

        "abstract": "Many scientific software platforms provide plugin mechanisms that simplify\nthe integration, deployment, and execution of externally developed\nfunctionality. One of the most widely used platforms in the imaging space is\nFiji, a popular open-source application for scientific image analysis. Fiji\nincorporates and builds on the ImageJ and ImageJ2 platforms, which provide a\npowerful plugin architecture used by thousands of plugins to solve a wide\nvariety of problems. This capability is a major part of Fiji's success, and it\nhas become a widely used biological image analysis tool and a target for new\nfunctionality. However, a plugin-based software architecture cannot unify\ndisparate platforms operating on incompatible data structures; interoperability\nnecessitates the creation of adaptation or \"bridge\" layers to translate data\nand invoke functionality. As a result, while platforms like Fiji enable a high\ndegree of interconnectivity and extensibility, they were not fundamentally\ndesigned to integrate across the many data types, programming languages, and\narchitectural differences of various software platforms.To help address this\nchallenge, we present SciJava Ops, a foundational software library for\nexpressing algorithms as plugins in a unified and extensible way. Continuing\nthe evolution of Fiji's SciJava plugin mechanism, SciJava Ops enables users to\nharness algorithms from various software platforms within a central execution\nenvironment. In addition, SciJava Ops automatically adapts data into the most\nappropriate structure for each algorithm, allowing users to freely and\ntransparently combine algorithms from otherwise incompatible tools. While\nSciJava Ops is initially distributed as a Fiji update site, the framework does\nnot require Fiji, ImageJ, or ImageJ2, and would be suitable for integration\nwith additional image analysis platforms.",

However, the theoretical justification for\nusing these systems has not yet been well established. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the universality of stochastic reservoir computers, in which we use\na stochastic system for reservoir computing using the probabilities of each\nreservoir state as the readout instead of the states themselves. In stochastic\nreservoir computing, the number of distinct states of the entire reservoir\ncomputer can potentially scale exponentially with the size of the reservoir\nhardware, offering the advantage of compact device size. We prove that classes\nof stochastic echo state networks, and therefore the class of all stochastic\nreservoir computers, are universal approximating classes. We also investigate\nthe performance of two practical examples of stochastic reservoir computers in\nclassification and chaotic time series prediction. While shot noise is a\nlimiting factor in the performance of stochastic reservoir computing, we show\nsignificantly improved performance compared to a deterministic reservoir\ncomputer with similar hardware in cases where the effects of noise are small.",

The HINTS method combines neural\noperators (NOs) with standard iterative solvers, e.g. Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel\n(GS), to achieve better performance by leveraging the spectral bias of neural\nnetworks. In HINTS, some iterations of the conventional iterative method are\nreplaced by inferences of the pre-trained NO. In this work, we employ HINTS to\nsolve the scattering problem for both 2D and 3D problems, where the standard\niterative solver fails. We consider square and triangular scatterers of various\nsizes in 2D, and a cube and a model submarine in 3D. We explore and illustrate\nthe extrapolation capability of HINTS in handling diverse geometries of the\nscatterer, which is achieved by training the NO on non-scattering scenarios and\nthen deploying it in HINTS to solve scattering problems. The accurate results\ndemonstrate that the NO in HINTS method remains effective without retraining or\nfine-tuning it whenever a new scatterer is given.

        "abstract": "Embedding news articles is a crucial tool for multiple fields, such as media\nbias detection, identifying fake news, and news recommendations. However,\nexisting news embedding methods are not optimized for capturing the latent\ncontext of news events. In many cases, news embedding methods rely on\nfull-textual information and neglect the importance of time-relevant embedding\ngeneration. Here, we aim to address these shortcomings by presenting a novel\nlightweight method that optimizes news embedding generation by focusing on the\nentities and themes mentioned in the articles and their historical connections\nto specific events. We suggest a method composed of three stages. First, we\nprocess and extract the events, entities, and themes for the given news\narticles. Second, we generate periodic time embeddings for themes and entities\nby training timely separated GloVe models on current and historical data.\nLastly, we concatenate the news embeddings generated by two distinct\napproaches: Smooth Inverse Frequency (SIF) for article-level vectors and\nSiamese Neural Networks for embeddings with nuanced event-related information.\nTo test and evaluate our method, we leveraged over 850,000 news articles and\n1,000,000 events from the GDELT project. For validation purposes, we conducted\na comparative analysis of different news embedding generation methods, applying\nthem twice to a shared event detection task - first on articles published\nwithin the same day and subsequently on those published within the same month.\nOur experiments show that our method significantly improves the\nPrecision-Recall (PR) AUC across all tasks and datasets. Specifically, we\nobserved an average PR AUC improvement of 2.15% and 2.57% compared to SIF, as\nwell as 2.57% and 2.43% compared to the semi-supervised approach for daily and\nmonthly shared event detection tasks, respectively.",

A set of\nsynthetic questions are then generated on these atoms (with the chunk as the\ncontext). Dense retrieval involves finding the closest set of synthetic\nquestions, and associated chunks, to the user query. It is found that retrieval\nwith the atoms leads to higher recall than retrieval with chunks. Further\nperformance gain is observed with retrieval using the synthetic questions\ngenerated over the atoms. Higher recall at the retrieval step enables higher\nperformance of the enterprise LLM using the RAG pipeline.",

Accelerated acquisition with sparse samples is desirable but\noften causes degraded image quality or long reconstruction time. We propose the\nReconstruct Paired Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (Re-Con-GAN) to\nshorten the 4D MRI reconstruction time while maintaining the reconstruction\nquality.\n  Methods: Patients who underwent free-breathing liver 4D MRI were included in\nthe study. Fully- and retrospectively under-sampled data at 3, 6 and 10 times\n(3x, 6x and 10x) were first reconstructed using the nuFFT algorithm. Re-Con-GAN\nthen trained input and output in pairs. Three types of networks, ResNet9, UNet\nand reconstruction swin transformer, were explored as generators. PatchGAN was\nselected as the discriminator. Re-Con-GAN processed the data (3D+t) as temporal\nslices (2D+t). A total of 48 patients with 12332 temporal slices were split\ninto training (37 patients with 10721 slices) and test (11 patients with 1611\nslices).\n  Results: Re-Con-GAN consistently achieved comparable/better PSNR, SSIM, and\nRMSE scores compared to CS/UNet models. The inference time of Re-Con-GAN, UNet\nand CS are 0.15s, 0.16s, and 120s. The GTV detection task showed that\nRe-Con-GAN and CS, compared to UNet, better improved the dice score (3x\nRe-Con-GAN 80.98%; 3x CS 80.74%; 3x UNet 79.88%) of unprocessed under-sampled\nimages (3x 69.61%).\n  Conclusion: A generative network with adversarial training is proposed with\npromising and efficient reconstruction results demonstrated on an in-house\ndataset.

        "abstract": "For many space applications, traditional control methods are often used\nduring operation. However, as the number of space assets continues to grow,\nautonomous operation can enable rapid development of control methods for\ndifferent space related tasks. One method of developing autonomous control is\nReinforcement Learning (RL), which has become increasingly popular after\ndemonstrating promising performance and success across many complex tasks.\nWhile it is common for RL agents to learn bounded continuous control values,\nthis may not be realistic or practical for many space tasks that traditionally\nprefer an on/off approach for control. This paper analyzes using discrete\naction spaces, where the agent must choose from a predefined list of actions.\nThe experiments explore how the number of choices provided to the agents\naffects their measured performance during and after training. This analysis is\nconducted for an inspection task, where the agent must circumnavigate an object\nto inspect points on its surface, and a docking task, where the agent must move\ninto proximity of another spacecraft and \"dock\" with a low relative speed. A\ncommon objective of both tasks, and most space tasks in general, is to minimize\nfuel usage, which motivates the agent to regularly choose an action that uses\nno fuel. Our results show that a limited number of discrete choices leads to\noptimal performance for the inspection task, while continuous control leads to\noptimal performance for the docking task.",

        "abstract": "Quantum Computing aims to streamline machine learning, making it more\neffective with fewer trainable parameters. This reduction of parameters can\nspeed up the learning process and reduce the use of computational resources.\nHowever, in the current phase of quantum computing development, known as the\nnoisy intermediate-scale quantum era (NISQ), learning is difficult due to a\nlimited number of qubits and widespread quantum noise. To overcome these\nchallenges, researchers are focusing on variational quantum circuits (VQCs).\nVQCs are hybrid algorithms that merge a quantum circuit, which can be adjusted\nthrough parameters, with traditional classical optimization techniques. These\ncircuits require only few qubits for effective learning. Recent studies have\npresented new ways of applying VQCs to reinforcement learning, showing\npromising results that warrant further exploration. This study investigates the\neffects of various techniques -- data re-uploading, input scaling, output\nscaling -- and introduces exponential learning rate decay in the quantum\nproximal policy optimization algorithm's actor-VQC. We assess these methods in\nthe popular Frozen Lake and Cart Pole environments. Our focus is on their\nability to reduce the number of parameters in the VQC without losing\neffectiveness.

To bridge this gap, we develop a probabilistic intent-based whole-page\ndiversification framework in the final stage of a recommender system. Starting\nwith a prior belief of user intents, the proposed diversification framework\nsequentially selects items at each position based on these beliefs, and\nsubsequently updates posterior beliefs about the intents. It ensures that\ndifferent user intents are represented in a page towards optimizing long-term\nuser experience.\n  We experiment with the intent diversification framework on one of the world's\nlargest content recommendation platforms, serving billions of users daily. Our\nframework incorporates the user's exploration intent, capturing their\npropensity to explore new interests and content. Live experiments show that the\nproposed framework leads to an increase in user retention and overall user\nenjoyment, validating its effectiveness in facilitating long-term planning. In\nparticular, it enables users to consistently discover and engage with diverse\ncontents that align with their underlying intents over time, thereby leading to\nan improved long-term user experience.",

By producing clear and comprehensible\nexplanations, XAI enables users, practitioners, and stakeholders to trust a\nmodel's decisions. This work analyses the value of data morphology strategies\nin generating counterfactual explanations. It introduces the Overlap Number of\nBalls Model-Agnostic CounterFactuals (ONB-MACF) method, a model-agnostic\ncounterfactual generator that leverages data morphology to estimate a model's\ndecision boundaries. The ONB-MACF method constructs hyperspheres in the data\nspace whose covered points share a class, mapping the decision boundary.\nCounterfactuals are then generated by incrementally adjusting an instance's\nattributes towards the nearest alternate-class hypersphere, crossing the\ndecision boundary with minimal modifications. By design, the ONB-MACF method\ngenerates feasible and sparse counterfactuals that follow the data\ndistribution. Our comprehensive benchmark from a double perspective\n(quantitative and qualitative) shows that the ONB-MACF method outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art counterfactual generation methods across multiple\nquality metrics on diverse tabular datasets.

Existing approaches oftentimes suffer from limited power\nin capturing nonlinear structures, insufficient account of noisiness and\neffects of high-dimensionality, lack of adaptivity to signals and sample sizes\nimbalance, and their results are sometimes difficult to interpret. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a novel kernel spectral method that achieves\njoint embeddings of two independently observed high-dimensional noisy datasets.\nThe proposed method automatically captures and leverages possibly shared\nlow-dimensional structures across datasets to enhance embedding quality. The\nobtained low-dimensional embeddings can be utilized for many downstream tasks\nsuch as simultaneous clustering, data visualization, and denoising. The\nproposed method is justified by rigorous theoretical analysis. Specifically, we\nshow the consistency of our method in recovering the low-dimensional noiseless\nsignals, and characterize the effects of the signal-to-noise ratios on the\nrates of convergence. Under a joint manifolds model framework, we establish the\nconvergence of ultimate embeddings to the eigenfunctions of some newly\nintroduced integral operators. These operators, referred to as duo-landmark\nintegral operators, are defined by the convolutional kernel maps of some\nreproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). These RKHSs capture the either\npartially or entirely shared underlying low-dimensional nonlinear signal\nstructures of the two datasets.

        "abstract": "Microservices architecture has been established as an ideal software\narchitecture for cloud-based software development and deployment, offering many\nbenefits such as agility and efficiency. Microservices are often associated\nwith containers and container orchestration systems for deployment, as\ncontainerization provides convenient tools and techniques for resource\nmanagement, including the automation of orchestration processes. Among the\nfactors that make the cloud suitable for commercial software deployment,\ntransient pricing options like AWS Spot Pricing are particularly attractive as\nthey allow consumers to significantly reduce cloud costs. However, the dynamic\nnature of resource demand and the abrupt termination of spot VMs make transient\npricing challenging.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a full solution for decentralized routing in Low Earth\nOrbit satellite constellations based on continual Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL). This requires addressing multiple challenges, including the partial\nknowledge at the satellites and their continuous movement, and the time-varying\nsources of uncertainty in the system, such as traffic, communication links, or\ncommunication buffers. We follow a multi-agent approach, where each satellite\nacts as an independent decision-making agent, while acquiring a limited\nknowledge of the environment based on the feedback received from the nearby\nagents. The solution is divided into two phases. First, an offline learning\nphase relies on decentralized decisions and a global Deep Neural Network (DNN)\ntrained with global experiences. Then, the online phase with local, on-board,\nand pre-trained DNNs requires continual learning to evolve with the\nenvironment, which can be done in two different ways: (1) Model anticipation,\nwhere the predictable conditions of the constellation are exploited by each\nsatellite sharing local model with the next satellite; and (2) Federated\nLearning (FL), where each agent's model is merged first at the cluster level\nand then aggregated in a global Parameter Server. The results show that,\nwithout high congestion, the proposed Multi-Agent DRL framework achieves the\nsame E2E performance as a shortest-path solution, but the latter assumes\nintensive communication overhead for real-time network-wise knowledge of the\nsystem at a centralized node, whereas ours only requires limited feedback\nexchange among first neighbour satellites. Importantly, our solution adapts\nwell to congestion conditions and exploits less loaded paths. Moreover, the\ndivergence of models over time is easily tackled by the synergy between\nanticipation, applied in short-term alignment, and FL, utilized for long-term\nalignment.",

        "abstract": "High-Level Synthesis enables the rapid prototyping of hardware accelerators,\nby combining a high-level description of the functional behavior of a kernel\nwith a set of micro-architecture optimizations as inputs. Such optimizations\ncan be described by inserting pragmas for e.g. pipelining and replication of\nunits, or even higher level transformations for HLS such as automatic data\ncaching using the AMD/Xilinx Merlin compiler. Selecting the best combination of\npragmas, even within a restricted set, remains particularly challenging and the\ntypical state-of-practice uses design-space exploration to navigate this space.\nBut due to the highly irregular performance distribution of pragma\nconfigurations, typical DSE approaches are either extremely time consuming, or\noperating on a severely restricted search space.\n  In this work we propose a framework to automatically insert HLS pragmas in\nregular loop-based programs, supporting pipelining, unit replication (coarse-\nand fine-grain), and data caching. We develop an analytical performance and\nresource model as a function of the input program properties and pragmas\ninserted, using non-linear constraints and objectives. We prove this model\nprovides a lower bound on the actual performance after HLS. We then encode this\nmodel as a Non-Linear Program, by making the pragma configuration unknowns of\nthe system, which is computed optimally by solving this NLP. This approach can\nalso be used during DSE, to quickly prune points with a (possibly partial)\npragma configuration, driven by lower bounds on achievable latency.

However, there\ncan be a number of novel solutions to this problem keeping in mind any of the\ntwo objectives to be attained, i.e. to increase diversity in the tasks and to\nreduce the confidence of the model for some of the tasks. In light of the\nabove, this paper proposes a number of solutions to tackle meta-overfitting on\nfew-shot learning settings, such as few-shot sinusoid regression and few shot\nclassification. Our proposed approaches demonstrate improved generalization\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art baselines for learning in a\nnon-mutually exclusive task setting.

        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are recognized as potent tools for processing\nreal-world data organized in graph structures. Especially inductive GNNs, which\nenable the processing of graph-structured data without relying on predefined\ngraph structures, are gaining importance in an increasingly wide variety of\napplications. As these networks demonstrate proficiency across a range of\ntasks, they become lucrative targets for model-stealing attacks where an\nadversary seeks to replicate the functionality of the targeted network. A large\neffort has been made to develop model-stealing attacks that focus on models\ntrained with images and texts. However, little attention has been paid to GNNs\ntrained on graph data. This paper introduces a novel method for unsupervised\nmodel-stealing attacks against inductive GNNs, based on graph contrasting\nlearning and spectral graph augmentations to efficiently extract information\nfrom the target model. The proposed attack is thoroughly evaluated on six\ndatasets. The results show that this approach demonstrates a higher level of\nefficiency compared to existing stealing attacks. More concretely, our attack\noutperforms the baseline on all benchmarks achieving higher fidelity and\ndownstream accuracy of the stolen model while requiring fewer queries sent to\nthe target model.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12217v1",
        "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that large multimodal models (LMMs) are highly robust\nagainst natural distribution shifts, often surpassing previous baselines.\nDespite this, domain-specific adaptation is still necessary, particularly in\nspecialized areas like healthcare. Due to the impracticality of fine-tuning\nLMMs given their vast parameter space, this work investigates in-context\nlearning (ICL) as an effective alternative for enhancing LMMs' adaptability. We\nfind that the success of ICL heavily relies on the choice of demonstration,\nmirroring challenges seen in large language models but introducing unique\ncomplexities for LMMs facing distribution shifts. Our study addresses this by\nevaluating an unsupervised ICL method, TopKNearestPR, which selects in-context\nexamples through a nearest example search based on feature similarity. We\nuncover that its effectiveness is limited by the deficiencies of pre-trained\nvision encoders under distribution shift scenarios. To address these\nchallenges, we propose InvariantSelectPR, a novel method leveraging\nClass-conditioned Contrastive Invariance (CCI) for more robust demonstration\nselection. Specifically, CCI enhances pre-trained vision encoders by improving\ntheir discriminative capabilities across different classes and ensuring\ninvariance to domain-specific variations. This enhancement allows the encoders\nto effectively identify and retrieve the most informative examples, which are\nthen used to guide LMMs in adapting to new query samples under varying\ndistributions. Our experiments show that InvariantSelectPR substantially\nimproves the adaptability of LMMs, achieving significant performance gains on\nbenchmark datasets, with a 34.2%$\\uparrow$ accuracy increase in 7-shot on\nCamelyon17 and 16.9%$\\uparrow$ increase in 7-shot on HAM10000 compared to the\nbaseline zero-shot performance.",

In experiments across 9 robotic\nplatforms, we demonstrate that Octo serves as a versatile policy initialization\nthat can be effectively finetuned to new observation and action spaces.

        "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in\nimage synthesis and editing. However, leveraging such pretrained models for\nvideo editing is considered a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to\nenforce temporal consistency in the edited video through explicit\ncorrespondence mechanisms, either in pixel space or between deep features.\nThese methods, however, struggle with strong nonrigid motion. In this paper, we\nintroduce a fundamentally different approach, which is based on the observation\nthat spatiotemporal slices of natural videos exhibit similar characteristics to\nnatural images. Thus, the same T2I diffusion model that is normally used only\nas a prior on video frames, can also serve as a strong prior for enhancing\ntemporal consistency by applying it on spatiotemporal slices. Based on this\nobservation, we present Slicedit, a method for text-based video editing that\nutilizes a pretrained T2I diffusion model to process both spatial and\nspatiotemporal slices. Our method generates videos that retain the structure\nand motion of the original video while adhering to the target text. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate Slicedit's ability to edit a wide range\nof real-world videos, confirming its clear advantages compared to existing\ncompeting methods.

        "abstract": "Relative entropy coding (REC) algorithms encode a random sample following a\ntarget distribution $Q$, using a coding distribution $P$ shared between the\nsender and receiver. Sadly, general REC algorithms suffer from prohibitive\nencoding times, at least on the order of $2^{D_{\\text{KL}}[Q||P]}$, and faster\nalgorithms are limited to very specific settings. This work addresses this\nissue by introducing a REC scheme utilizing space partitioning to reduce\nruntime in practical scenarios. We provide theoretical analyses of our method\nand demonstrate its effectiveness with both toy examples and practical\napplications.

In experiments, the proposed MvACon is thoroughly tested on\nthe nuScenes benchmark, using both the BEVFormer and its recent 3D deformable\nattention (DFA3D) variant, as well as the PETR, showing consistent detection\nperformance improvement, especially in enhancing performance in location,\norientation, and velocity prediction.

        "abstract": "Modern cameras typically offer two types of image states: a minimally\nprocessed linear raw RGB image representing the raw sensor data, and a\nhighly-processed non-linear image state, such as the sRGB state. The CIE-XYZ\ncolor space is a device-independent linear space used as part of the camera\npipeline and can be helpful for computer vision tasks, such as image\ndeblurring, dehazing, and color recognition tasks in medical applications,\nwhere color accuracy is important. However, images are usually saved in\nnon-linear states, and achieving CIE-XYZ color images using conventional\nmethods is not always possible. To tackle this issue, classical methodologies\nhave been developed that focus on reversing the acquisition pipeline. More\nrecently, supervised learning has been employed, using paired CIE-XYZ and sRGB\nrepresentations of identical images. However, obtaining a large-scale dataset\nof CIE-XYZ and sRGB pairs can be challenging. To overcome this limitation and\nmitigate the reliance on large amounts of paired data, self-supervised learning\n(SSL) can be utilized as a substitute for relying solely on paired data. This\npaper proposes a framework for using SSL methods alongside paired data to\nreconstruct CIE-XYZ images and re-render sRGB images, outperforming existing\napproaches. The proposed framework is applied to the sRGB2XYZ dataset.",

We then construct a\nmetric polyhedron $P(\\mathcal{L})$ and an isometric embedding (called Yoneda\nembedding) of $\\mathcal{L}$ into $P(\\mathcal{L})$ such that texts map to\ngenerators of certain special extremal rays. We explain that $P(\\mathcal{L})$\nis a $(\\min,+)$ (tropical) linear span of these extremal ray generators. The\ngenerators also satisfy a system of $(\\min+)$ linear equations. We then show\nthat $P(\\mathcal{L})$ is compatible with adding more text and from this we\nderive an approximation of a text vector as a Boltzmann weighted linear\ncombination of the vectors for words in that text.

        "abstract": "The fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks starts a paradigm shift from\nthe traditional monolithic system design to a Service Based Architecture, that\nfits modern performance requirements and scales efficiently to new services.\nThis paradigm will be the foundation of future cellular core networks beyond\n5G. The new architecture splits network functionalities into smaller logical\nentities that can be disaggregated logically, physically, and geographically.\nThis affords interoperability between the mobile network operators and\ncommercial software and hardware vendors or cloud providers. By making use of\ncommodity services and products, this system construct inherits the\nvulnerabilities in those underlying technologies, thereby increasing its attack\nsurface and requiring a rigorous security analysis. In this work, we review the\nsecurity implications introduced in B5G networks, and the security mechanisms\nthat are supported by the 5G standard. We emphasize on the support of Zero\nTrust Architecture in 5G and its relevance in decentralized deployments. We\nrevisit the definition of trust in modern enterprise network operations and\nidentify important Zero Trust properties that are weakened by the nature of\ncloud deployments. To that end, we propose a vertical extension of Zero Trust,\nnamely, Zero Trust Execution, to model untrusted execution environments, and we\nprovide an analysis on how to establish trust in Beyond-5G network\narchitectures using Trusted Execution Environments. Our analysis shows how our\nmodel architecture handles the increased attack surface and reinforces the Zero\nTrust Architecture principles in the 5G Core, without any changes to the 5G\nstandard. Finally, we provide experimental results over a 5G testbed using\nOpen5GS and UERANSIM that demonstrate minimal performance overhead, and a\nmonetary cost evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Text-to-Table aims to generate structured tables to convey the key\ninformation from unstructured documents. Existing text-to-table datasets are\ntypically oriented English, limiting the research in non-English languages.\nMeanwhile, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown great\nsuccess as general task solvers in multi-lingual settings (e.g., ChatGPT),\ntheoretically enabling text-to-table in other languages. In this paper, we\npropose a Chinese text-to-table dataset, CT-Eval, to benchmark LLMs on this\ntask. Our preliminary analysis of English text-to-table datasets highlights two\nkey factors for dataset construction: data diversity and data hallucination.\nInspired by this, the CT-Eval dataset selects a popular Chinese\nmultidisciplinary online encyclopedia as the source and covers 28 domains to\nensure data diversity. To minimize data hallucination, we first train an LLM to\njudge and filter out the task samples with hallucination, then employ human\nannotators to clean the hallucinations in the validation and testing sets.\nAfter this process, CT-Eval contains 88.6K task samples. Using CT-Eval, we\nevaluate the performance of open-source and closed-source LLMs. Our results\nreveal that zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4) still have a significant\nperformance gap compared with human judgment. Furthermore, after fine-tuning,\nopen-source LLMs can significantly improve their text-to-table ability,\noutperforming GPT-4 by a large margin. In short, CT-Eval not only helps\nresearchers evaluate and quickly understand the Chinese text-to-table ability\nof existing LLMs but also serves as a valuable resource to significantly\nimprove the text-to-table performance of LLMs.",

The four\ntop-ranked software products are 3D Slicer, ImageJ, Fiji, and OHIF Viewer.\nGenerally, MI software is in a healthy state as shown by the following: we\nobserved 88% of the documentation artifacts recommended by research software\ndevelopment guidelines, 100% of MI projects use version control tools, and\ndevelopers appear to use the common quasi-agile research software development\nprocess. However, the current state of the practice deviates from the existing\nguidelines because of the rarity of some recommended artifacts, low usage of\ncontinuous integration (17% of the projects), low use of unit testing (about\n50% of projects), and room for improvement with documentation (six of nine\ndevelopers felt their documentation was not clear enough). From interviewing\nthe developers, we identified five pain points and two qualities of potential\nconcern: lack of development time, lack of funding, technology hurdles,\nensuring correctness, usability, maintainability, and reproducibility. The\ninterviewees proposed strategies to improve the state of the practice, to\naddress the identified pain points, and to improve software quality.

        "abstract": "Although Wi-Fi is an ideal technology for many ranging applications, the\nperformance of current methods is limited by the system bandwidth, leading to\nlow accuracy of $\\sim 1$ m. For many applications, measuring differential\nrange, viz., the change in the range between adjacent measurements, is\nsufficient. Correspondingly, this work proposes WiDRa - a Wi-Fi based\nDifferential Ranging solution that provides differential range estimates by\nusing the sum-carrier-phase information. The proposed method is not limited by\nsystem bandwidth and can track range changes even smaller than the carrier\nwavelength. The proposed method is first theoretically justified, while taking\ninto consideration the various hardware impairments affecting Wi-Fi chips. In\nthe process, methods to isolate the sum-carrier phase from the hardware\nimpairments are proposed. Extensive simulation results show that WiDRa can\nachieve a differential range estimation root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of\n$\\approx 1$ mm in channels with a Rician-factor $\\geq 7$ (a $100 \\times$\nimprovement to existing methods). The proposed methods are also validated on\noff-the-shelf Wi-Fi hardware to demonstrate feasibility, where they achieve an\nRMSE of $< 1$ mm in the differential range. Finally, limitations of current\ninvestigation and future directions of exploration are suggested, to further\ntap into the potential of WiDRa.",

However, the complexities inherent in human intent\nnecessitate a dependence on labor-intensive and time-consuming human\nevaluation. To alleviate this constraint, we delve into the paradigm of\nemploying open-source large language models as evaluators, aligning with the\nprevailing trend of utilizing GPT-4. Particularly, we present a step-by-step\nevaluation framework: \\textbf{Fennec}, capable of \\textbf{F}ine-grained\n\\textbf{E}valuatio\\textbf{N} and correctio\\textbf{N} \\textbf{E}xtended through\nbran\\textbf{C}hing and bridging. Specifically, the branching operation dissects\nthe evaluation task into various dimensions and granularities, thereby\nalleviating the challenges associated with evaluation.

In experimental trials, our 7B model consistently\noutperforms open-source larger-scale evaluation models across various widely\nadopted benchmarks in terms of both \\textit{Agreement} and\n\\textit{Consistency}, closely approaching the capabilities of GPT-4.

Neural radiance field (NeRF)\nand 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) have recently emerged as two promising 3D\nrepresentation techniques based on radiance field rendering, which are able to\nprovide photorealistic rendering results for complex scenes. Therefore,\nembracing NeRF and 3D-GS in 6G networks is envisioned to be a prominent\nsolution to support emerging 3D applications with enhanced quality of\nexperience.

Next, we consider the over-the-air training\nof NeRF and 3D-GS models over wireless networks by presenting various learning\ntechniques. We particularly focus on the federated learning design over a\nhierarchical device-edge-cloud architecture. Then, we discuss three practical\nrendering architectures of NeRF and 3D-GS models at wireless network edge. We\nprovide model compression approaches to facilitate the transmission of radiance\nfield models, and present rendering acceleration approaches and joint\ncomputation and communication designs to enhance the rendering efficiency. In\nparticular, we propose a new semantic communication enabled 3D content\ntransmission design, in which the radiance field models are exploited as the\nsemantic knowledge base to reduce the communication overhead for distributed\ninference.

It is\nguaranteed that the sum of the sizes of all items present at any time is at\nmost a $(1-\\varepsilon)$-fraction of the total size of memory (i.e., the\nload-factor is at most $1-\\varepsilon$). The allocator receives insert and\ndelete requests online, and can re-arrange existing items to handle the\nrequests, but at a reallocation cost defined to be the sum of the sizes of\nitems moved divided by the size of the item being inserted/deleted.\n  The folklore algorithm for Memory Reallocation achieves a cost of\n$O(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ per update. In recent work at FOCS'23, Kuszmaul showed\nthat, in the special case where each item is promised to be smaller than an\n$\\varepsilon^4$-fraction of memory, it is possible to achieve expected update\ncost $O(\\log\\varepsilon^{-1})$.

In this study, we\nimplement five representative classifiers (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive\nBayes, SVM, and kNN) based on this framework and evaluate their throughput and\nlatency. By conducting the experimental measurements, we investigate the\ndifference in the processing performance among these classifiers and the\nbottlenecks in the processing performance of the framework.",

        "abstract": "Visual Language Tracking (VLT) enhances single object tracking (SOT) by\nintegrating natural language descriptions from a video, for the precise\ntracking of a specified object. By leveraging high-level semantic information,\nVLT guides object tracking, alleviating the constraints associated with relying\non a visual modality. Nevertheless, most VLT benchmarks are annotated in a\nsingle granularity and lack a coherent semantic framework to provide scientific\nguidance. Moreover, coordinating human annotators for high-quality annotations\nis laborious and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce\nDTLLM-VLT, which automatically generates extensive and multi-granularity text\nto enhance environmental diversity. (1) DTLLM-VLT generates scientific and\nmulti-granularity text descriptions using a cohesive prompt framework. Its\nsuccinct and highly adaptable design allows seamless integration into various\nvisual tracking benchmarks. (2) We select three prominent benchmarks to deploy\nour approach: short-term tracking, long-term tracking, and global instance\ntracking. We offer four granularity combinations for these benchmarks,\nconsidering the extent and density of semantic information, thereby showcasing\nthe practicality and versatility of DTLLM-VLT. (3) We conduct comparative\nexperiments on VLT benchmarks with different text granularities, evaluating and\nanalyzing the impact of diverse text on tracking performance.

For aerial\nmanipulators, the baselink position and attitude errors directly affect the\nprecision at the end effector.

Additionally, conventional arm-equipped multirotors, called\nrotor-concentrated manipulators (RCMs), find it difficult to generate a large\nwrench at the end effector due to joint torque limitations.

This research investigates Active Learning (AL)\nstrategies to reduce the amount of labeled data needed for effective time\nseries classification. Traditional AL techniques cannot control the selection\nof instances per class for labeling, leading to potential bias in\nclassification performance and instance selection, particularly in imbalanced\ntime series datasets. To address this, we propose a novel class-balancing\ninstance selection algorithm integrated with standard AL strategies.

Thus, we propose a\nReindex-Then-Adapt (RTA) framework, which converts multi-token item titles into\nsingle tokens within LLMs, and then adjusts the probability distributions over\nthese single-token item titles accordingly. The RTA framework marries the\nbenefits of both LLMs and traditional recommender systems (RecSys):\nunderstanding complex queries as LLMs do; while efficiently controlling the\nrecommended item distributions in conversational recommendations as traditional\nRecSys do.

On the other hand,\nRust-embedded DSL like Halo2 or Boojum lack in modularity; furthermore, it is\nusually impossible to tease apart the circuit from the proof system, making it\nhard to reuse circuits and even to compare performance of different proof\nsystems on the same circuits.\n  In this paper we introduce Clap, the first Rust eDSL to propose a\nprover-agnostic circuit format that enables extensibility, automatic\noptimizations, and formal guarantees for the resulting constraint system. Clap\ngenerates Plonkish constraint systems and witness generators that are sound and\ncomplete with respect to each other, leaving no room for subtle bugs due to\nunder- or over-constraining.

        "abstract": "The cross-channel deblurring problem in color image processing is difficult\nto solve due to the complex coupling and structural blurring of color pixels.\nUntil now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color infection\nin deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel\ncross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image\ndeblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space\nregularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution is\nproved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a sweet balance of\nregularization functionals on different color spaces.\n  The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into\naccount the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each\ncolor channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to\nenhance the ability of color infection reduction of the CSTV regularization\nmodel. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models.\nNumerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and\nmanoeuvrability of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by\nthem successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher\nquality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of\nthe-state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) creates a radiance field consisting of 3D\nGaussians to represent a scene. With sparse training views, 3DGS easily suffers\nfrom overfitting, negatively impacting the reconstruction quality. This paper\nintroduces a new co-regularization perspective for improving sparse-view 3DGS.\nWhen training two 3D Gaussian radiance fields with the same sparse views of a\nscene, we observe that the two radiance fields exhibit \\textit{point\ndisagreement} and \\textit{rendering disagreement} that can unsupervisedly\npredict reconstruction quality, stemming from the sampling implementation in\ndensification. We further quantify the point disagreement and rendering\ndisagreement by evaluating the registration between Gaussians' point\nrepresentations and calculating differences in their rendered pixels. The\nempirical study demonstrates the negative correlation between the two\ndisagreements and accurate reconstruction, which allows us to identify\ninaccurate reconstruction without accessing ground-truth information. Based on\nthe study, we propose CoR-GS, which identifies and suppresses inaccurate\nreconstruction based on the two disagreements: (\\romannumeral1) Co-pruning\nconsiders Gaussians that exhibit high point disagreement in inaccurate\npositions and prunes them. (\\romannumeral2) Pseudo-view co-regularization\nconsiders pixels that exhibit high rendering disagreement are inaccurately\nrendered and suppress the disagreement. Results on LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, DTU, and\nBlender demonstrate that CoR-GS effectively regularizes the scene geometry,\nreconstructs the compact representations, and achieves state-of-the-art novel\nview synthesis quality under sparse training views.",

        "abstract": "Human language is a unique form of communication in the natural world,\ndistinguished by its structured nature. Most fundamentally, it is systematic,\nmeaning that signals can be broken down into component parts that are\nindividually meaningful -- roughly, words -- which are combined in a regular\nway to form sentences. Furthermore, the way in which these parts are combined\nmaintains a kind of locality: words are usually concatenated together, and they\nform contiguous phrases, keeping related parts of sentences close to each\nother. We address the challenge of understanding how these basic properties of\nlanguage arise from broader principles of efficient communication under\ninformation processing constraints. Here we show that natural-language-like\nsystematicity arises from minimization of excess entropy, a measure of\nstatistical complexity that represents the minimum amount of information\nnecessary for predicting the future of a sequence based on its past. In\nsimulations, we show that codes that minimize excess entropy factorize their\nsource distributions into approximately independent components, and then\nexpress those components systematically and locally. Next, in a series of\nmassively cross-linguistic corpus studies, we show that human languages are\nstructured to have low excess entropy at the level of phonology, morphology,\nsyntax, and semantics. Our result suggests that human language performs a\nsequential generalization of Independent Components Analysis on the statistical\ndistribution over meanings that need to be expressed. It establishes a link\nbetween the statistical and algebraic structure of human language, and\nreinforces the idea that the structure of human language may have evolved to\nminimize cognitive load while maximizing communicative expressiveness.",

A Single Event Upset (SEU), which is also called a soft error,\ncan reverse a bit in a sequential element, resulting in a system failure.\nSimulation-based fault injection has been widely used to evaluate reliability,\nas suggested by ISO26262. However, it is practically impossible to test all\nfaults for a complex design. Random fault injection is a compromise that\nreduces accuracy and fault coverage. Formal verification is an alternative\napproach. In this paper, we use formal verification, in the form of model\nchecking, to evaluate the hardware reliability of a RISC-V Ibex Core in the\npresence of soft errors. Backward tracing is performed to identify and\ncategorize faults according to their effects (no effect, Silent Data\nCorruption, crashes, and hangs). By using formal verification, the entire state\nspace and fault list can be exhaustively explored. It is found that misaligned\ninstructions can amplify fault effects. It is also found that some bits are\nmore vulnerable to SEUs than others. In general, most of the bits in the Ibex\nCore are vulnerable to Silent Data Corruption, and the second pipeline stage is\nmore vulnerable to Silent Data Corruption than the first.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12084v1",
        "abstract": "Current language models are built on the so-called distributional semantic\napproach to linguistic meaning that has the distributional hypothesis at its\ncore. The distributional hypothesis involves a holistic conception of word\nmeaning: the meaning of a word depends upon its relations to other words in the\nmodel. A standard objection to meaning holism is the charge of instability: any\nchange in the meaning properties of a linguistic system (a human speaker, for\nexample) would lead to many changes or possibly a complete change in the entire\nsystem. When the systems in question are trying to communicate with each other,\nit has been argued that instability of this kind makes communication impossible\n(Fodor and Lepore 1992, 1996, 1999). In this article, we examine whether the\ninstability objection poses a problem for distributional models of meaning.\nFirst, we distinguish between distinct forms of instability that these models\ncould exhibit, and we argue that only one such form is relevant for\nunderstanding the relation between instability and communication: what we call\ndifferential instability. Differential instability is variation in the relative\ndistances between points in a space, rather than variation in the absolute\nposition of those points. We distinguish differential and absolute instability\nby constructing two of our own models, a toy model constructed from the text of\ntwo novels, and a more sophisticated model constructed using the Word2vec\nalgorithm from a combination of Wikipedia and SEP articles. We demonstrate the\ntwo forms of instability by showing how these models change as the corpora they\nare constructed from increase in size.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12081v1",
        "abstract": "To obtain high-quality annotations under limited budget, semi-automatic\nannotation methods are commonly used, where a portion of the data is annotated\nby experts and a model is then trained to complete the annotations for the\nremaining data. However, these methods mainly focus on selecting informative\ndata for expert annotations to improve the model predictive ability (i.e.,\ntriage-to-human data), while the rest of the data is indiscriminately assigned\nto model annotation (i.e., triage-to-model data). This may lead to\ninefficiencies in budget allocation for annotations, as easy data that the\nmodel could accurately annotate may be unnecessarily assigned to the expert,\nand hard data may be misclassified by the model. As a result, the overall\nannotation quality may be compromised. To address this issue, we propose a\nselective annotation framework called SANT. It effectively takes advantage of\nboth the triage-to-human and triage-to-model data through the proposed\nerror-aware triage and bi-weighting mechanisms. As such, informative or hard\ndata is assigned to the expert for annotation, while easy data is handled by\nthe model. Experimental results show that SANT consistently outperforms other\nbaselines, leading to higher-quality annotation through its proper allocation\nof data to both expert and model workers. We provide pioneering work on data\nannotation within budget constraints, establishing a landmark for future\ntriage-based annotation studies.",

POS is\nan OS-level GPU C/R system: It can transparently checkpoint or restore\nprocesses that use the GPU, without requiring any cooperation from the\napplication, a key feature required by modern systems like the cloud. Moreover,\nPOS is the first OS-level C/R system that can concurrently execute C/R with the\napplication execution: a critical feature that can be trivially achieved when\nthe processes only running on the CPU, but becomes challenging when the\nprocesses use GPU. The problem is how to ensure consistency during concurrent\nexecution with the lack of application semantics due to transparency. CPU\nprocesses can leverage OS and hardware paging to fix inconsistency without\napplication semantics. Unfortunately, GPU bypasses OS and paging for high\nperformance. POS fills the semantic gap by speculatively extracting buffer\naccess information of GPU kernels during runtime. Thanks to the simple and\nwell-structured nature of GPU kernels, our speculative extraction (with runtime\nvalidation) achieves 100% accuracy on applications from training to inference\nwhose domains span from vision, large language models, and reinforcement\nlearning.

Artificial intelligence and Machine learning\nalgorithms have proven to be effective measures to accurately predict the smart\ngrid's stability.

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized learning technique that enables\nparticipating devices to collaboratively build a shared Machine Leaning (ML) or\nDeep Learning (DL) model without revealing their raw data to a third party. Due\nto its privacy-preserving nature, FL has sparked widespread attention for\nbuilding Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) within the realm of cybersecurity.\nHowever, the data heterogeneity across participating domains and entities\npresents significant challenges for the reliable implementation of an FL-based\nIDS. In this paper, we propose an effective method called Statistical Averaging\n(StatAvg) to alleviate non-independently and identically (non-iid) distributed\nfeatures across local clients' data in FL. In particular, StatAvg allows the FL\nclients to share their individual data statistics with the server, which then\naggregates this information to produce global statistics. The latter are shared\nwith the clients and used for universal data normalisation. It is worth\nmentioning that StatAvg can seamlessly integrate with any FL aggregation\nstrategy, as it occurs before the actual FL training process. The proposed\nmethod is evaluated against baseline approaches using datasets for network and\nhost Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered IDS. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the efficiency of StatAvg in mitigating non-iid feature\ndistributions across the FL clients compared to the baseline methods.",

However, most existing methods only reconstruct a head without\nthe body, substantially limiting their application scenarios. We found that\nnaively applying Gaussians to model the clothed chest and shoulders tends to\nresult in blurry reconstruction and noisy floaters under novel poses. This is\nbecause of the fundamental limitation of Gaussians and point clouds -- each\nGaussian or point can only have a single directional radiance without spatial\nvariance, therefore an unnecessarily large number of them is required to\nrepresent complicated spatially varying texture, even for simple geometry. In\ncontrast, we propose to model the body part with a neural texture that consists\nof coarse and pose-dependent fine colors. To properly render the body texture\nfor each view and pose without accurate geometry nor UV mapping, we optimize\nanother sparse set of Gaussians as anchors that constrain the neural warping\nfield that maps image plane coordinates to the texture space. We demonstrate\nthat Gaussian Head & Shoulders can fit the high-frequency details on the\nclothed upper body with high fidelity and potentially improve the accuracy and\nfidelity of the head region. We evaluate our method with casual phone-captured\nand internet videos and show our method archives superior reconstruction\nquality and robustness in both self and cross reenactment tasks.

This study explores\nthree important factors influencing variation in crowdsourced polarity\njudgments, focusing on TripAdvisor reviews in Spanish. Three hypotheses are\ntested: the role of Part Of Speech (POS), the impact of sentiment words such as\n\"tasty\", and the influence of neutral words like \"ok\" on judgment variation.\nThe study's methodology employs one-word titles, demonstrating their efficacy\nin studying polarity variation of words. Statistical tests on mean equality are\nperformed on word groups of our interest. The results of this study reveal that\nadjectives in one-word titles tend to result in lower judgment variation\ncompared to other word types or POS. Sentiment words contribute to lower\njudgment variation as well, emphasizing the significance of sentiment words in\nresearch on polarity judgments, and neutral words are associated with higher\njudgment variation as expected. However, these effects cannot be always\nreproduced in longer titles, which suggests that longer titles do not represent\nthe best data source for testing the ambiguity of single words due to the\ninfluence on word polarity by other words like negation in longer titles. This\nempirical investigation contributes valuable insights into the factors\ninfluencing polarity variation of words, providing a foundation for NLP\npractitioners that aim to capture and predict polarity judgments in Spanish and\nfor researchers that aim to understand factors influencing judgment variation.",

Clustering involves\nextensive computations to calculate distances at each iteration, which\nincreases as the number of data points increases. This provides scope for\nparallelism. However, we must ensure that in a parallel process, each thread\nhas access to the updated centroid value and no racing condition exists on any\ncentroid values. We will compare two different approaches in this project. The\nfirst approach is an OpenMP flat synchronous method where all processes are run\nin parallel, and we use synchronization to ensure safe updates of clusters. The\nsecond approach we adopt is a GPU based parallelization approach using OpenACC\nwherein we will try to make use of GPU architecture to parallelize chunks of\nthe algorithm to observe decreased computation time.

However, during the MLSTF process,\nextracting the global time series patterns and understanding the correlations\namong different variables are highly significant. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce multi-resolution convolution and deformable convolution operations.\nBy enlarging the receptive field using convolution kernels with different\ndilation factors to capture temporal correlation information across different\nresolutions, and adaptively adjusting the sampling positions through additional\noffset vectors, we enhance the network's ability to capture correlated features\nbetween variables. Building upon this, we propose ATVCNet, an adaptive\ntemporal-variable convolutional network designed to effectively model the\nlocal/global temporal dependencies and inter-variable dependencies of\nmultivariate time series. Specifically, extracting and fusing time series\nfeatures at different resolutions, captures both local contextual information\nand global patterns in the time series. The designed inter-variable feature\nadaptive extraction module captures the correlation among different variables\nin the time series. We evaluated the performance of ATVCNet across eight\nreal-world datasets.

CMS-CU stores $m$ counters and employs $d$ hash functions to map\nitems to these counters. We first argue that the estimation error in CMS-CU is\nmaximal when each item appears at most once in the stream. Next, we study\nCMS-CU in this setting. In the case where $d=m-1$, we prove that the average\nestimation error and the average counter rate converge almost surely to\n$\\frac{1}{2}$, contrasting with the vanilla Count-Min Sketch, where the average\ncounter rate is equal to $\\frac{m-1}{m}$. For any given $m$ and $d$, we prove\nnovel lower and upper bounds on the average estimation error, incorporating a\npositive integer parameter $g$. Larger values of this parameter improve the\naccuracy of the bounds. Moreover, the computation of each bound involves\nexamining an ergodic Markov process with a state space of size\n$\\binom{m+g-d}{g}$ and a sparse transition probabilities matrix containing\n$\\mathcal{O}(m\\binom{m+g-d}{g})$ non-zero entries.

The\nsequence learning module is a crucial part wherein transformers have\ndemonstrated their efficacy in the sequence-to-sequence tasks. Analyzing the\nresearch progress in the field of Natural Language Processing and Speech\nRecognition, a rapid introduction of various transformer variants is observed.\nHowever, in the realm of sign language, experimentation in the sequence\nlearning component is limited. In this work, the state-of-the-art Conformer\nmodel for Speech Recognition is adapted for CSLR and the proposed model is\ntermed ConSignformer. This marks the first instance of employing Conformer for\na vision-based task. ConSignformer has bimodal pipeline of CNN as feature\nextractor and Conformer for sequence learning. For improved context learning we\nalso introduce Cross-Modal Relative Attention (CMRA). By incorporating CMRA\ninto the model, it becomes more adept at learning and utilizing complex\nrelationships within the data. To further enhance the Conformer model,\nunsupervised pretraining called Regressional Feature Extraction is conducted on\na curated sign language dataset. The pretrained Conformer is then fine-tuned\nfor the downstream recognition task. The experimental results confirm the\neffectiveness of the adopted pretraining strategy and demonstrate how CMRA\ncontributes to the recognition process.

Strategy-proofness is crucial as it ensures\nthat buyers are incentivized to bid their true valuations, leading to optimal\nand fair auction outcomes without the risk of manipulation. Building on\nconformal prediction, we introduce a novel approach to achieve\nstrategy-proofness with rigorous statistical guarantees. The key novelties of\nour method are: (i) the formulation of a regret prediction model, used to\nquantify at test time violations of strategy-proofness; and (ii) an auction\nacceptance rule that leverages the predicted regret to ensure that for a new\nauction, the data-driven mechanism meets the strategy-proofness requirement\nwith high probability (e.g., 99\\%). Numerical experiments demonstrate the\nnecessity for rigorous guarantees, the validity of our theoretical results, and\nthe applicability of our proposed method.",

However, several challenges persist\n1) RNNs struggle with centric feature aggregation and are sensitive to\ninterfering pixels, 2) Transformers require significant computational resources\nand often underperform with limited HSI training samples, and 3) Current\nscanning methods for converting images into sequence-data are simplistic and\ninefficient.

        "abstract": "Offline meta reinforcement learning (OMRL) has emerged as a promising\napproach for interaction avoidance and strong generalization performance by\nleveraging pre-collected data and meta-learning techniques. Previous\ncontext-based approaches predominantly rely on the intuition that maximizing\nthe mutual information between the task and the task representation ($I(Z;M)$)\ncan lead to performance improvements. Despite achieving attractive results, the\ntheoretical justification of performance improvement for such intuition has\nbeen lacking. Motivated by the return discrepancy scheme in the model-based RL\nfield, we find that maximizing $I(Z;M)$ can be interpreted as consistently\nraising the lower bound of the expected return for a given policy conditioning\non the optimal task representation. However, this optimization process ignores\nthe task representation shift between two consecutive updates, which may lead\nto performance improvement collapse. To address this problem, we turn to use\nthe framework of performance difference bound to consider the impacts of task\nrepresentation shift explicitly. We demonstrate that by reining the task\nrepresentation shift, it is possible to achieve monotonic performance\nimprovements, thereby showcasing the advantage against previous approaches. To\nmake it practical, we design an easy yet highly effective algorithm RETRO\n(\\underline{RE}ining \\underline{T}ask \\underline{R}epresentation shift in\ncontext-based \\underline{O}ffline meta reinforcement learning) with only adding\none line of code compared to the backbone.

        "abstract": "Collective intelligence of diverse groups is key for tackling many of today's\ngrand challenges such as fostering resilience and climate adaptation.\nInformation exchange across such diverse groups is crucial for collective\nintelligence, especially in volatile environments. To facilitate inter-group\ninformation exchange, Informational Boundary Spanners (IBSs) as pivotal\ninformation exchange 'hubs' are promising. However, the mechanisms that drive\nthe emergence of IBSs remain poorly understood. To address this gap there is\nfirst a need for a method to identify and measure the emergence of IBSs.\nSecond, an Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) framework is not available to\nsystematically study mechanisms for the emergence of IBSs in volatile\nenvironments. Third, even though the ability to learn who provides high-quality\ninformation is thought to be essential to explain the emergence of IBSs, a\nrigorous test of this mechanism is missing. The learning mechanism is\nformalized using an ABM framework, with the model's outputs analyzed using the\nproposed IBS emergence measurement method. To illustrate both the method and\nthe learning mechanism, we present a case study focused on information sharing\nin the volatile environment of a disaster. The study shows that learning\nconstitutes a mechanism for the emergence of effective IBSs in (a)\nlow-volatility environments characterised by low uncertainty and (b) in\nhigh-volatility environments characterised by rapid change if the number of\ninter-group connections is sufficient. With the method and model, this paper\naims to lay the foundations for exploring mechanisms for the emergence of IBSs\nthat facilitate inter-group information exchange. This article advances\ncollective intelligence by providing the essential elements for measuring and\nunderstanding the emergence of IBSs and exploring the effect of learning on\ntheir emergence in volatile environments.",

While downlink Multiple-Input Multiple-Ouput (MIMO) RSMA has\nbeen widely investigated, uplink MIMO RSMA has not been fully explored. In this\npaper, we investigate the performance of uplink RSMA in short-packet\ncommunications with perfect Channel State Information at Transmitter (CSIT) and\nChannel State Information at Receiver (CSIR). We propose an uplink MIMO RSMA\nframework and optimize both precoders and combiners with Max-Min Fairness (MMF)\nmetric and Finite Blocklength (FBL) constraints. Due to the high coupling\nbetween precoders and combiners, we apply the Alternating Optimization (AO) to\ndecompose the optimization problem into two subproblems. To tackle these\nsubproblems, we propose a Successive Convex Approximation (SCA)-based approach.\nAdditionally, we introduce a low-complexity scheme to design the decoding order\nat the receiver. Subsequently, the Physical (PHY)-layer of the uplink MIMO RSMA\narchitecture is designed and evaluated using multi-user Link-Level Simulations\n(LLS), accounting for finite constellation modulation, finite length polar\ncodes, message splitting, adaptive modulation and coding, and Successive\nInterference Cancellation (SIC) at the receiver.

Existing AI-based end-to-end solutions do not offer the\nnecessary safety guarantees, while traditional systems engineering approaches\nare defeated by the complexity of the problem. Currently, there is an\nincreasing interest in hybrid design solutions, integrating machine learning\ncomponents, when necessary, while using model-based components for goal\nmanagement and planning.\n  We study a method for building safe by design autonomous driving systems,\nbased on the assumption that the capability to drive boils down to the\ncoordinated execution of a given set of driving operations. The assumption is\nsubstantiated by a compositionality result considering that autopilots are\ndynamic systems receiving a small number of types of vistas as input, each\nvista defining a free space in its neighborhood. It is shown that safe driving\nfor each type of vista in the corresponding free space, implies safe driving\nfor any possible scenario under some easy-to-check conditions concerning the\ntransition between vistas. The designed autopilot comprises distinct control\npolicies one per type of vista, articulated in two consecutive phases. The\nfirst phase consists of carefully managing a potentially risky situation by\nvirtually reducing speed, while the second phase consists of exiting the\nsituation by accelerating.\n  The autopilots designed use for their predictions simple functions\ncharacterizing the acceleration and deceleration capabilities of the vehicles.\nThey cover the main driving operations, including entering a main road,\novertaking, crossing intersections protected by traffic lights or signals, and\ndriving on freeways.

Recently, Barthe, Hsu and Liao have proposed a new way of\ngiving semantics to separation logic formulas in which separating conjunction\nis interpreted in terms of probabilistic independence. The latter is taken in\nits exact form, i.e., two events are independent if and only if the joint\nprobability is the product of the probabilities of the two events. There is\nindeed a literature on weaker notions of independence which are computational\nin nature, i.e. independence holds only against efficient adversaries and\nmodulo a negligible probability of success. The aim of this work is to explore\nthe nature of computational independence in a cryptographic scenario, in view\nof the aforementioned advances in separation logic. We show on the one hand\nthat the semantics of separation logic can be adapted so as to account for\ncomplexity bounded adversaries, and on the other hand that the obtained logical\nsystem is useful for writing simple and compact proofs of standard\ncryptographic results in which the adversary remains hidden.

Consider\nan online scheduler that receives a series of tasks, where each task has both a\nparallel and a serial implementation. The parallel implementation has the\nadvantage that it can make progress concurrently on multiple processors, but\nthe disadvantage that it is (potentially) work-inefficient. As tasks arrive,\nthe scheduler must decide for each task which implementation to use.\n  We begin by studying \\emph{total awake time}. We give a simple\n\\emph{decide-on-arrival} scheduler that achieves a competitive ratio of $3$ for\ntotal awake time -- this scheduler makes serial/parallel decisions immediately\nwhen jobs arrive. Our second result is an \\emph{parallel-work-oblivious}\nscheduler that achieves a competitive ratio of $6$ for total awake time -- this\nscheduler makes all of its decisions based only on the size of each serial job\nand without needing to know anything about the parallel implementations.\nFinally, we prove a lower bound showing that, if a scheduler wishes to achieve\na competitive ratio of $O(1)$, it can have at most one of the two\naforementioned properties (decide-on-arrival or parallel-work-oblivious). We\nalso prove lower bounds of the form $1 + \\Omega(1)$ on the optimal competitive\nratio for any scheduler.\n  Next, we turn our attention to optimizing \\emph{mean response time}. Here, we\nshow that it is possible to achieve an $O(1)$ competitive ratio with $O(1)$\nspeed augmentation. This is the most technically involved of our results. We\nalso prove that, in this setting, it is not possible for a\nparallel-work-oblivious scheduler to do well.\n  In addition to these results, we present tight bounds on the optimal\ncompetitive ratio if we allow for arrival dependencies between tasks (e.g.,\ntasks are components of a single parallel program), and we give an in-depth\ndiscussion of the remaining open questions.",

        "abstract": "Text-Centric Visual Question Answering (TEC-VQA) in its proper format not\nonly facilitates human-machine interaction in text-centric visual environments\nbut also serves as a de facto gold proxy to evaluate AI models in the domain of\ntext-centric scene understanding. However, most TEC-VQA benchmarks have focused\non high-resource languages like English and Chinese. Despite pioneering works\nto expand multilingual QA pairs in non-text-centric VQA datasets using\ntranslation engines, the translation-based protocol encounters a substantial\n``Visual-textual misalignment'' problem when applied to TEC-VQA. Specifically,\nit prioritizes the text in question-answer pairs while disregarding the visual\ntext present in images. Furthermore, it does not adequately tackle challenges\nrelated to nuanced meaning, contextual distortion, language bias, and\nquestion-type diversity. In this work, we address the task of multilingual\nTEC-VQA and provide a benchmark with high-quality human expert annotations in 9\ndiverse languages, called MTVQA. To our knowledge, MTVQA is the first\nmultilingual TEC-VQA benchmark to provide human expert annotations for\ntext-centric scenarios. Further, by evaluating several state-of-the-art\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), including GPT-4V, on our MTVQA\ndataset, it is evident that there is still room for performance improvement,\nunderscoring the value of our dataset.

        "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms can suffer from modeling errors\nbetween the simulation and the real world. Many studies use adversarial\nlearning to generate perturbation during training process to model the\ndiscrepancy and improve the robustness of DRL. However, most of these\napproaches use a fixed parameter to control the intensity of the adversarial\nperturbation, which can lead to a trade-off between average performance and\nrobustness. In fact, finding the optimal parameter of the perturbation is\nchallenging, as excessive perturbations may destabilize training and compromise\nagent performance, while insufficient perturbations may not impart enough\ninformation to enhance robustness. To keep the training stable while improving\nrobustness, we propose a simple but effective method, namely, Adaptive\nAdversarial Perturbation (A2P), which can dynamically select appropriate\nadversarial perturbations for each sample. Specifically, we propose an adaptive\nadversarial coefficient framework to adjust the effect of the adversarial\nperturbation during training. By designing a metric for the current intensity\nof the perturbation, our method can calculate the suitable perturbation levels\nbased on the current relative performance. The appealing feature of our method\nis that it is simple to deploy in real-world applications and does not require\naccessing the simulator in advance. The experiments in MuJoCo show that our\nmethod can improve the training stability and learn a robust policy when\nmigrated to different test environments.

The performance improvement of the TPR\nmodel relies on high-quality data for supervised training.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have\napproached or even surpassed human performance on many NLP tasks, creating the\npossibility to expand high-quality TPR datasets.

LLM-DA uses LLMs to\nrewrite the text in the current TPR dataset, achieving high-quality expansion\nof the dataset concisely and efficiently. These rewritten texts are able to\nincrease the diversity of vocabulary and sentence structure while retaining the\noriginal key concepts and semantic information. In order to alleviate the\nhallucinations of LLMs, LLM-DA introduces a Text Faithfulness Filter (TFF) to\nfilter out unfaithful rewritten text. To balance the contributions of original\ntext and augmented text, a Balanced Sampling Strategy (BSS) is proposed to\ncontrol the proportion of original text and augmented text used for training.\nLLM-DA is a plug-and-play method that can be easily integrated into various TPR\nmodels.

However, in science, hallucinations may be useful: they are novel\nhypotheses whose validity may be tested by laboratory experiments. Here we\nexperimentally test the use of LLMs as a source of scientific hypotheses using\nthe domain of breast cancer treatment. We applied the LLM GPT4 to hypothesize\nnovel pairs of FDA-approved non-cancer drugs that target the MCF7 breast cancer\ncell line relative to the non-tumorigenic breast cell line MCF10A. In the first\nround of laboratory experiments GPT4 succeeded in discovering three drug\ncombinations (out of 12 tested) with synergy scores above the positive\ncontrols. These combinations were itraconazole + atenolol, disulfiram +\nsimvastatin and dipyridamole + mebendazole. GPT4 was then asked to generate new\ncombinations after considering its initial results. It then discovered three\nmore combinations with positive synergy scores (out of four tested), these were\ndisulfiram + fulvestrant, mebendazole + quinacrine and disulfiram + quinacrine.\nA limitation of GPT4 as a generator of hypotheses was that its explanations for\nthem were formulaic and unconvincing. We conclude that LLMs are an exciting\nnovel source of scientific hypotheses.",

        "abstract": "Software is at the core of most scientific discoveries today. Therefore, the\nquality of research results highly depends on the quality of the research\nsoftware. Rigorous testing, as we know it from software engineering in the\nindustry, could ensure the quality of the research software but it also\nrequires a substantial effort that is often not rewarded in academia.\nTherefore, this research explores the effects of research software testing\nintegrated into teaching on research software. In an in-vivo experiment, we\nintegrated the engineering of a test suite for a large-scale network simulation\nas group projects into a course on software testing at the Blekinge Institute\nof Technology, Sweden, and qualitatively measured the effects of this\nintegration on the research software. We found that the research software\nbenefited from the integration through substantially improved documentation and\nfewer hardware and software dependencies. However, this integration was\neffortful and although the student teams developed elegant and thoughtful test\nsuites, no code by students went directly into the research software since we\nwere not able to make the integration back into the research software\nobligatory or even remunerative. Although we strongly believe that integrating\nresearch software engineering such as testing into teaching is not only\nvaluable for the research software itself but also for students, the research\nof the next generation, as they get in touch with research software engineering\nand bleeding-edge research in their field as part of their education, the\nuncertainty about the intellectual properties of students' code substantially\nlimits the potential of integrating research software testing into teaching.",

        "abstract": "Integrating electric vehicles (EVs) into the power grid can revolutionize\nenergy management strategies, offering both challenges and opportunities for\ncreating a more sustainable and resilient grid. In this context, model\npredictive control (MPC) emerges as a powerful tool for addressing the\ncomplexities of Grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enabled demand\nresponse management. By leveraging advanced optimization techniques, MPC\nalgorithms can anticipate future grid conditions and dynamically adjust EV\ncharging and discharging schedules to balance supply and demand while\nminimizing operational costs and maximizing flexibility. However, no standard\ntools exist to evaluate novel energy management strategies based on MPC\napproaches. Our research focuses on harnessing the potential of MPC in G2V and\nV2G applications, by providing a simulation tool that allows to maximize EV\nflexibility and support demand response initiatives while mitigating the impact\non EV battery health. In this paper, we propose an open-source MPC controller\nfor G2V and V2G-enabled demand response management. The proposed approach is\ncapable of tackling the uncertainties inherent in demand response operations.\nThrough extensive simulation and analysis, we demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach in maximizing the benefits of G2V and V2G while assessing the impact\non the longevity and reliability of EV batteries.

        "abstract": "Various iterative eigenvalue solvers have been developed to compute parts of\nthe spectrum for a large sparse matrix, including the power method, Krylov\nsubspace methods, contour integral methods, and preconditioned solvers such as\nthe so called LOBPCG method. All of these solvers rely on random matrices to\ndetermine, e.g., starting vectors that have, with high probability, a\nnon-negligible overlap with the eigenvectors of interest. For this purpose, a\nsafe and common choice are unstructured Gaussian random matrices. In this work,\nwe investigate the use of random Khatri-Rao products in eigenvalue solvers. On\nthe one hand, we establish a novel subspace embedding property that provides\ntheoretical justification for the use of such structured random matrices. On\nthe other hand, we highlight the potential algorithmic benefits when solving\neigenvalue problems with Kronecker product structure, as they arise frequently\nfrom the discretization of eigenvalue problems for differential operators on\ntensor product domains. In particular, we consider the use of random Khatri-Rao\nproducts within a contour integral method and LOBPCG. Numerical experiments\nindicate that the gains for the contour integral method strongly depend on the\nability to efficiently and accurately solve (shifted) matrix equations with\nlow-rank right-hand side. The flexibility of LOBPCG to directly employ\npreconditioners makes it easier to benefit from Khatri-Rao product structure,\nat the expense of having less theoretical justification.",

Packaging machines are widely used in a large\nnumber of logistic companies' warehouses and must be working uninterruptedly.\nTraditionally, preventive maintenance strategies have been carried out to\nimprove the performance of these machines.

The key idea is that, from a set of alarms related to sensors\nimplemented in the machine, the expert system should take a maintenance action\nwhile optimizing the response time. The work order estimator will act as a\nclassifier, yielding a binary decision of whether a machine must undergo a\nmaintenance action by a technician or not, followed by an unsupervised anomaly\ndetection-based filtering stage to audit the classifier's output.

        "abstract": "Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)-based congestion control schemes have\nbeen widely adopted in high-speed data center networks (DCNs), where the ECN\nmarking threshold plays a determinant role in guaranteeing a packet lossless\nDCN. However, existing approaches either employ static settings with immutable\nthresholds that cannot be dynamically self-adjusted to adapt to network\ndynamics, or fail to take into account many-to-one traffic patterns and\ndifferent requirements of different types of traffic, resulting in relatively\npoor performance. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel\nlearning-based automatic ECN tuning scheme, named PET, based on the multi-agent\nIndependent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) algorithm. PET dynamically\nadjusts ECN thresholds by fully considering pivotal congestion-contributing\nfactors, including queue length, output data rate, output rate of ECN-marked\npackets, current ECN threshold, the extent of incast, and the ratio of mice and\nelephant flows. PET adopts the Decentralized Training and Decentralized\nExecution (DTDE) paradigm and combines offline and online training to\naccommodate network dynamics. PET is also fair and readily deployable with\ncommodity hardware. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that,\ncompared with state-of-the-art static schemes and the learning-based automatic\nscheme, our PET achieves better performance in terms of flow completion time,\nconvergence rate, queue length variance, and system robustness.",

        "abstract": "Reduced order models are becoming increasingly important for rendering\ncomplex and multiscale spatio-temporal dynamics computationally tractable. The\ncomputational efficiency of such surrogate models is especially important for\ndesign, exhaustive exploration and physical understanding. Plasma simulations,\nin particular those applied to the study of ${\\bf E}\\times {\\bf B}$ plasma\ndischarges and technologies, such as Hall thrusters, require substantial\ncomputational resources in order to resolve the multidimentional dynamics that\nspan across wide spatial and temporal scales. Although high-fidelity\ncomputational tools are available to simulate such systems over limited\nconditions and in highly simplified geometries, simulations of full-size\nsystems and/or extensive parametric studies over many geometric configurations\nand under different physical conditions are computationally intractable with\nconventional numerical tools. Thus, scientific studies and industrially\noriented modeling of plasma systems, including the important ${\\bf E}\\times\n{\\bf B}$ technologies, stand to significantly benefit from reduced order\nmodeling algorithms. We develop a model reduction scheme based upon a {\\em\nShallow REcurrent Decoder} (SHRED) architecture.

Based upon\nthe theory of separation of variables, the SHRED architecture is capable of (i)\nreconstructing full spatio-temporal fields with as little as three point\nsensors, even the fields that are not measured with sensor feeds but that are\nin dynamic coupling with the measured field, and (ii) forecasting the future\nstate of the system using neural network roll-outs from the trained time\nencoding model.",

        "abstract": "Open source developers have emerged as key actors in the political economy of\nartificial intelligence (AI), with open model development being recognised as\nan alternative to closed-source AI development. However, we still have a\nlimited understanding of collaborative practices in open source AI. This paper\nresponds to this gap with a three-part quantitative analysis of development\nactivity on the Hugging Face (HF) Hub, a popular platform for building,\nsharing, and demonstrating models. First, we find that various types of\nactivity across 348,181 model, 65,761 dataset, and 156,642 space repositories\nexhibit right-skewed distributions. Activity is extremely imbalanced between\nrepositories; for example, over 70% of models have 0 downloads, while 1%\naccount for 99% of downloads. Second, we analyse a snapshot of the social\nnetwork structure of collaboration on models, finding that the community has a\ncore-periphery structure, with a core of prolific developers and a majority of\nisolate developers (89%). Upon removing isolates, collaboration is\ncharacterised by high reciprocity regardless of developers' network positions.\nThird, we examine model adoption through the lens of model usage in spaces,\nfinding that a minority of models, developed by a handful of companies, are\nwidely used on the HF Hub. Overall, we find that various types of activity on\nthe HF Hub are characterised by Pareto distributions, congruent with prior\nobservations about OSS development patterns on platforms like GitHub.

This research introduces the application of the Tree of Thoughts\n(ToT) language model reasoning framework for enhancing the decision-making and\nproblem-solving abilities of LLMs for this complex task. Compared to\ntraditional input-output (IO) prompting and Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG) techniques, ToT is designed to improve performance by facilitating a\nstructured exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories and enabling\nself-assessment of potential solutions. We experimentally deploy ToT in\ntackling a Github issue contained within an instance of the SWE-bench. However,\nour results reveal that the ToT framework alone is not enough to give LLMs the\ncritical reasoning capabilities to outperform existing methods. In this paper\nwe analyze the potential causes of these shortcomings and identify key areas\nfor improvement such as deepening the thought process and introducing agentic\ncapabilities.

        "abstract": "People use language for various purposes. Apart from sharing information,\nindividuals may use it to express emotions or to show respect for another\nperson. In this paper, we focus on the formality level of machine-generated\ntranslations and present FAME-MT -- a dataset consisting of 11.2 million\ntranslations between 15 European source languages and 8 European target\nlanguages classified to formal and informal classes according to target\nsentence formality. This dataset can be used to fine-tune machine translation\nmodels to ensure a given formality level for each European target language\nconsidered. We describe the dataset creation procedure, the analysis of the\ndataset's quality showing that FAME-MT is a reliable source of language\nregister information, and we present a publicly available proof-of-concept\nmachine translation model that uses the dataset to steer the formality level of\nthe translation. Currently, it is the largest dataset of formality annotations,\nwith examples expressed in 112 European language pairs. The dataset is\npublished online: https://github.com/laniqo-public/fame-mt/ .",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11941v1",
        "abstract": "Biomedical entity linking, a main component in automatic information\nextraction from health-related texts, plays a pivotal role in connecting\ntextual entities (such as diseases, drugs and body parts mentioned by patients)\nto their corresponding concepts in a structured biomedical knowledge base. The\ntask remains challenging despite recent developments in natural language\nprocessing. This paper presents the first evaluated biomedical entity linking\nmodel for the Dutch language. We use MedRoBERTa.nl as base model and perform\nsecond-phase pretraining through self-alignment on a Dutch biomedical ontology\nextracted from the UMLS and Dutch SNOMED. We derive a corpus from Wikipedia of\nontology-linked Dutch biomedical entities in context and fine-tune our model on\nthis dataset. We evaluate our model on the Dutch portion of the Mantra\nGSC-corpus and achieve 54.7% classification accuracy and 69.8% 1-distance\naccuracy. We then perform a case study on a collection of unlabeled,\npatient-support forum data and show that our model is hampered by the limited\nquality of the preceding entity recognition step. Manual evaluation of small\nsample indicates that of the correctly extracted entities, around 65% is linked\nto the correct concept in the ontology. Our results indicate that biomedical\nentity linking in a language other than English remains challenging, but our\nDutch model can be used to for high-level analysis of patient-generated text.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11939v1",
        "abstract": "A singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problem posed on the unit square in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$ is solved numerically by a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG)\nfinite element method. Typical solutions of this class of problem exhibit\nboundary layers along the sides of the domain; these layers generally cause\ndifficulties for numerical methods. Our LDG method handles the boundary layers\nby using a Shishkin mesh and also introducing the new concept of a\n``layer-upwind flux\" -- a discrete flux whose values are chosen on the fine\nmesh (which lies inside the boundary layers) in the direction where the layer\nweakens. On the coarse mesh, one can use a standard central flux. No penalty\nterms are needed with these fluxes, unlike many other variants of the LDG\nmethod. Our choice of discrete flux makes it feasible to derive an\noptimal-order error analysis in a balanced norm; this norm is stronger than the\nusual energy norm and is a more appropriate measure for errors in computed\nsolutions for singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problems. It will be\nproved that the LDG method is usually convergent of order $O((N^{-1}\\ln\nN)^{k+1})$ in the balanced norm, where $N$ is the number of mesh intervals in\neach coordinate direction and tensor-product piecewise polynomials of\ndegree~$k$ in each coordinate variable are used in the LDG method. This result\nis the first of its kind for the LDG method applied to this class of problem\nand is optimal for convergence on a Shishkin mesh. Its sharpness is confirmed\nby numerical experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding for self-improvement in\nmachine translation (MT), particularly for domain adaptation and low-resource\nlanguages. We implement the self-improvement process by fine-tuning the model\non its MBR-decoded forward translations. By employing COMET as the MBR utility\nmetric, we aim to achieve the reranking of translations that better aligns with\nhuman preferences. The paper explores the iterative application of this\napproach and the potential need for language-specific MBR utility metrics. The\nresults demonstrate significant enhancements in translation quality for all\nexamined language pairs, including successful application to domain-adapted\nmodels and generalisation to low-resource settings. This highlights the\npotential of COMET-guided MBR for efficient MT self-improvement in various\nscenarios.",

        "abstract": "The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has been widely extended\nrecently. It is crucial to ensure accurate latitude and longitude coordinates\nfor UAVs, especially when the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are\ndisrupted and unreliable. Existing visual localization methods achieve\nautonomous visual localization without error accumulation by matching the\nground-down view image of UAV with the ortho satellite maps. However,\ncollecting UAV ground-down view images across diverse locations is costly,\nleading to a scarcity of large-scale datasets for real-world scenarios.\nExisting datasets for UAV visual localization are often limited to small\ngeographic areas or are focused only on urban regions with distinct textures.\nTo address this, we define the UAV visual localization task by determining the\nUAV's real position coordinates on a large-scale satellite map based on the\ncaptured ground-down view. In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset,\nUAV-VisLoc, to facilitate the UAV visual localization task. This dataset\ncomprises images from diverse drones across 11 locations in China, capturing a\nrange of topographical features. The dataset features images from fixed-wing\ndrones and multi-terrain drones, captured at different altitudes and\norientations. Our dataset includes 6,742 drone images and 11 satellite maps,\nwith metadata such as latitude, longitude, altitude, and capture date. Our\ndataset is tailored to support both the training and testing of models by\nproviding a diverse and extensive data.",

Based on transformation optics, the\nspherical Luneburg lens is compressed into a cylindrical one, while the merits\nof high gain, broad band, wide scanning, and free polarization are preserved. A\ntrigonometric function is employed to the material property of the flattened\nLuneburg lens with reduced anisotropy, thus effectively alleviates the strong\nreflection, the high sidelobes and back radiation with a free cost on the\nantenna weight and volume. Furthermore, a light thin wideband 7-by-1\nmetasurface phased array is studied as the primary feed for the LLA. The\nproposed metantenna, shorted for metamaterial-based antenna, has a high\npotential for B5G, future wireless communication and radar sensing as an\nonboard system.",
