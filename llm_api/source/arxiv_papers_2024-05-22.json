        "abstract": "Envy-free cake-cutting protocols procedurally divide an infinitely divisible\ngood among a set of agents so that no agent prefers another's allocation to\ntheir own. These protocols are highly complex and difficult to prove correct.\nRecently, Bertram, Levinson, and Hsu introduced a language called Slice for\ndescribing and verifying cake-cutting protocols. Slice programs can be\ntranslated to formulas encoding envy-freeness, which are solved by SMT. While\nSlice works well on smaller protocols, it has difficulty scaling to more\ncomplex cake-cutting protocols.\n  We improve Slice in two ways. First, we show any protocol execution in Slice\ncan be replicated using piecewise uniform valuations. We then reduce Slice's\nconstraint formulas to formulas within the theory of linear real arithmetic,\nshowing that verifying envy-freeness is efficiently decidable. Second, we\ndesign and implement a linear type system which enforces that no two agents\nreceive the same part of the good. We implement our methods and verify a range\nof challenging examples, including the first nontrivial four-agent protocol.",

        "abstract": "Organizational decision-making is crucial for success, yet cognitive biases\ncan significantly affect risk preferences, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Risk\nseeking preferences for losses, driven by biases such as loss aversion, pose\nchallenges and can result in severe negative consequences, including financial\nlosses. This research introduces the ABI approach, a novel solution designed to\nsupport organizational decision-makers by automatically identifying and\nexplaining risk seeking preferences during decision-making. This research makes\na novel contribution by automating the identification and explanation of risk\nseeking preferences using Cumulative Prospect theory (CPT) from Behavioral\nEconomics. The ABI approach transforms theoretical insights into actionable,\nreal-time guidance, making them accessible to a broader range of organizations\nand decision-makers without requiring specialized personnel. By contextualizing\nCPT concepts into business language, the approach facilitates widespread\nadoption and enhances decision-making processes with deep behavioral insights.\nOur systematic literature review identified significant gaps in existing\nmethods, especially the lack of automated solutions with a concrete mechanism\nfor automatically identifying risk seeking preferences, and the absence of\nformal knowledge representation, such as ontologies, for identifying and\nexplaining the risk preferences. The ABI Approach addresses these gaps,\noffering a significant contribution to decision-making research and practice.\nFurthermore, it enables automatic collection of historical decision data with\nrisk preferences, providing valuable insights for enhancing strategic\nmanagement and long-term organizational performance. An experiment provided\npreliminary evidence on its effectiveness in helping decision-makers recognize\ntheir risk seeking preferences during decision-making in the loss domain.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new framework for algorithmic stability in the context of\nmulticlass classification. In practice, classification algorithms often operate\nby first assigning a continuous score (for instance, an estimated probability)\nto each possible label, then taking the maximizer -- i.e., selecting the class\nthat has the highest score. A drawback of this type of approach is that it is\ninherently unstable, meaning that it is very sensitive to slight perturbations\nof the training data, since taking the maximizer is discontinuous. Motivated by\nthis challenge, we propose a pipeline for constructing stable classifiers from\ndata, using bagging (i.e., resampling and averaging) to produce stable\ncontinuous scores, and then using a stable relaxation of argmax, which we call\nthe \"inflated argmax,\" to convert these scores to a set of candidate labels.\nThe resulting stability guarantee places no distributional assumptions on the\ndata, does not depend on the number of classes or dimensionality of the\ncovariates, and holds for any base classifier. Using a common benchmark data\nset, we demonstrate that the inflated argmax provides necessary protection\nagainst unstable classifiers, without loss of accuracy.",

        "abstract": "We present ChatScene, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent that leverages\nthe capabilities of LLMs to generate safety-critical scenarios for autonomous\nvehicles. Given unstructured language instructions, the agent first generates\ntextually described traffic scenarios using LLMs. These scenario descriptions\nare subsequently broken down into several sub-descriptions for specified\ndetails such as behaviors and locations of vehicles. The agent then\ndistinctively transforms the textually described sub-scenarios into\ndomain-specific languages, which then generate actual code for prediction and\ncontrol in simulators, facilitating the creation of diverse and complex\nscenarios within the CARLA simulation environment. A key part of our agent is a\ncomprehensive knowledge retrieval component, which efficiently translates\nspecific textual descriptions into corresponding domain-specific code snippets\nby training a knowledge database containing the scenario description and code\npairs. Extensive experimental results underscore the efficacy of ChatScene in\nimproving the safety of autonomous vehicles. For instance, the scenarios\ngenerated by ChatScene show a 15% increase in collision rates compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines when tested against different reinforcement\nlearning-based ego vehicles. Furthermore, we show that by using our generated\nsafety-critical scenarios to fine-tune different RL-based autonomous driving\nmodels, they can achieve a 9% reduction in collision rates, surpassing current\nSOTA methods. ChatScene effectively bridges the gap between textual\ndescriptions of traffic scenarios and practical CARLA simulations, providing a\nunified way to conveniently generate safety-critical scenarios for safety\ntesting and improvement for AVs.",

        "abstract": "We tackle the question of whether Large Language Models (LLMs), viewed as\ndynamical systems with state evolving in the embedding space of symbolic\ntokens, are observable. That is, whether there exist multiple 'mental' state\ntrajectories that yield the same sequence of generated tokens, or sequences\nthat belong to the same Nerode equivalence class ('meaning'). If not\nobservable, mental state trajectories ('experiences') evoked by an input\n('perception') or by feedback from the model's own state ('thoughts') could\nremain self-contained and evolve unbeknown to the user while being potentially\naccessible to the model provider. Such \"self-contained experiences evoked by\nperception or thought\" are akin to what the American Psychological Association\n(APA) defines as 'feelings'. Beyond the lexical curiosity, we show that current\nLLMs implemented by autoregressive Transformers cannot have 'feelings'\naccording to this definition: The set of state trajectories indistinguishable\nfrom the tokenized output is a singleton. But if there are 'system prompts' not\nvisible to the user, then the set of indistinguishable trajectories becomes\nnon-trivial, and there can be multiple state trajectories that yield the same\nverbalized output. We prove these claims analytically, and show examples of\nmodifications to standard LLMs that engender such 'feelings.' Our analysis\nsheds light on possible designs that would enable a model to perform\nnon-trivial computation that is not visible to the user, as well as on controls\nthat the provider of services using the model could take to prevent unintended\nbehavior.",

        "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful machine learning paradigm for\ngenerating agents that control autonomous systems. However, the \"black box\"\nnature of DRL agents limits their deployment in real-world safety-critical\napplications. A promising approach for providing strong guarantees on an\nagent's behavior is to use Neural Lyapunov Barrier (NLB) certificates, which\nare learned functions over the system whose properties indirectly imply that an\nagent behaves as desired. However, NLB-based certificates are typically\ndifficult to learn and even more difficult to verify, especially for complex\nsystems. In this work, we present a novel method for training and verifying\nNLB-based certificates for discrete-time systems. Specifically, we introduce a\ntechnique for certificate composition, which simplifies the verification of\nhighly-complex systems by strategically designing a sequence of certificates.\nWhen jointly verified with neural network verification engines, these\ncertificates provide a formal guarantee that a DRL agent both achieves its\ngoals and avoids unsafe behavior. Furthermore, we introduce a technique for\ncertificate filtering, which significantly simplifies the process of producing\nformally verified certificates.

IoT is known as a system that connects the world together and is the\nway to disseminate information so we build the system on IoT and use it as a\ncentral point for monitoring collating and managing our data.

This study\nfocuses on the joint design of the transmit/received beamformers at the\nCE/reader and the reflection coefficient of the tag. A throughput maximization\nproblem is thus formulated, subject to satisfying the tag requirements. We\ndevelop a joint design through a series of trial-and-error interactions within\nthe environment, driven by a predefined reward system in a continuous state and\naction context. We propose two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to\naddress the underlying optimization problem, namely deep deterministic policy\ngradient (DDPG) and soft actor-critic (SAC). Simulation results indicate that\nthe proposed algorithm can learn from the environment and incrementally enhance\nits behavior, achieving performance that is on par with two leading benchmarks.\nFurther, we also compared the performance of the proposed method with deep\nQ-network (DQN), double deep Q-network (DDQN), and dueling DQN (DuelDQN). For a\nsystem with twelve antennas, SAC leads with a 26.76% gain over DQN, followed by\nalternative optimization (AO) and DDPG at 23.02% and 19.16%.

Rigid\ninteractions are notoriously hard to model: small changes to the initial state\nor the simulation parameters can lead to large changes in the final state.\nRecently, learned simulators based on graph networks (GNNs) were developed as\nan alternative to hand-designed simulators like MuJoCo and PyBullet.

However, current state-of-the-art learned simulators operate on\nmeshes and scale poorly to scenes with many objects or detailed shapes.

We\nuse learned signed-distance functions (SDFs) to represent the object shapes and\nto speed up distance computation.

Previous studies on dense video\ncaptioning and video story generation have made some progress.

In this work, we introduce a new task of Synchronized\nVideo Storytelling, which aims to generate synchronous and informative\nnarrations for videos. These narrations, associated with each video clip,\nshould relate to the visual content, integrate relevant knowledge, and have an\nappropriate word count corresponding to the clip's duration. Specifically, a\nstructured storyline is beneficial to guide the generation process, ensuring\ncoherence and integrity. To support the exploration of this task, we introduce\na new benchmark dataset E-SyncVidStory with rich annotations. Since existing\nMultimodal LLMs are not effective in addressing this task in one-shot or\nfew-shot settings, we propose a framework named VideoNarrator that can generate\na storyline for input videos and simultaneously generate narrations with the\nguidance of the generated or predefined storyline.

Therefore, it is practical and necessary for\nrendering to synthesize BTFs from a small example patch. While previous methods\nmanaged to produce plausible results, we find that they seldomly take into\nconsideration the property of being dynamic, so a BTF must be synthesized\nbefore the rendering process, resulting in limited size, costly pre-generation\nand storage issues. In this paper, we propose a dynamic BTF synthesis scheme,\nwhere a BTF at any position only needs to be synthesized when being queried.\nOur insight is that, with the recent advances in neural dimension reduction\nmethods, a BTF can be decomposed into disjoint low-dimensional components. We\ncan perform dynamic synthesis only on the positional dimensions, and during\nrendering, recover the BTF by querying and combining these low-dimensional\nfunctions with the help of a lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).\nConsequently, we obtain a fully dynamic 6D BTF synthesis scheme that does not\nrequire any pre-generation, which enables efficient rendering of our infinitely\nlarge and non-repetitive BTFs on the fly.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14023v1",
        "abstract": "The recent breakthrough in large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has\nrevolutionized production processes at an unprecedented pace. Alongside this\nprogress also comes mounting concerns about LLMs' susceptibility to\njailbreaking attacks, which leads to the generation of harmful or unsafe\ncontent. While safety alignment measures have been implemented in LLMs to\nmitigate existing jailbreak attempts and force them to become increasingly\ncomplicated, it is still far from perfect. In this paper, we analyze the common\npattern of the current safety alignment and show that it is possible to exploit\nsuch patterns for jailbreaking attacks by simultaneous obfuscation in queries\nand responses. Specifically, we propose WordGame attack, which replaces\nmalicious words with word games to break down the adversarial intent of a query\nand encourage benign content regarding the games to precede the anticipated\nharmful content in the response, creating a context that is hardly covered by\nany corpus used for safety alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nWordGame attack can break the guardrails of the current leading proprietary and\nopen-source LLMs, including the latest Claude-3, GPT-4, and Llama-3 models.\nFurther ablation studies on such simultaneous obfuscation in query and response\nprovide evidence of the merits of the attack strategy beyond an individual\nattack.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning models comprising transformer components have\npushed the performance envelope in medical image synthesis tasks. Contrary to\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) that use static, local filters,\ntransformers use self-attention mechanisms to permit adaptive, non-local\nfiltering to sensitively capture long-range context. However, this sensitivity\ncomes at the expense of substantial model complexity, which can compromise\nlearning efficacy particularly on relatively modest-sized imaging datasets.\nHere, we propose a novel adversarial model for multi-modal medical image\nsynthesis, I2I-Mamba, that leverages selective state space modeling (SSM) to\nefficiently capture long-range context while maintaining local precision. To do\nthis, I2I-Mamba injects channel-mixed Mamba (cmMamba) blocks in the bottleneck\nof a convolutional backbone. In cmMamba blocks, SSM layers are used to learn\ncontext across the spatial dimension and channel-mixing layers are used to\nlearn context across the channel dimension of feature maps. Comprehensive\ndemonstrations are reported for imputing missing images in multi-contrast MRI\nand MRI-CT protocols. Our results indicate that I2I-Mamba offers superior\nperformance against state-of-the-art CNN- and transformer-based methods in\nsynthesizing target-modality images.",

        "abstract": "With the success of 2D and 3D visual generative models, there is growing\ninterest in generating 4D content. Existing methods primarily rely on text\nprompts to produce 4D content, but they often fall short of accurately defining\ncomplex or rare motions. To address this limitation, we propose MagicPose4D, a\nnovel framework for refined control over both appearance and motion in 4D\ngeneration. Unlike traditional methods, MagicPose4D accepts monocular videos as\nmotion prompts, enabling precise and customizable motion generation.\nMagicPose4D comprises two key modules:\n  i) Dual-Phase 4D Reconstruction Module} which operates in two phases. The\nfirst phase focuses on capturing the model's shape using accurate 2D\nsupervision and less accurate but geometrically informative 3D\npseudo-supervision without imposing skeleton constraints. The second phase\nrefines the model using more accurate pseudo-3D supervision, obtained in the\nfirst phase and introduces kinematic chain-based skeleton constraints to ensure\nphysical plausibility. Additionally, we propose a Global-local Chamfer loss\nthat aligns the overall distribution of predicted mesh vertices with the\nsupervision while maintaining part-level alignment without extra annotations.\n  ii) Cross-category Motion Transfer Module} leverages the predictions from the\n4D reconstruction module and uses a kinematic-chain-based skeleton to achieve\ncross-category motion transfer. It ensures smooth transitions between frames\nthrough dynamic rigidity, facilitating robust generalization without additional\ntraining.\n  Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MagicPose4D significantly\nimproves the accuracy and consistency of 4D content generation, outperforming\nexisting methods in various benchmarks.",

This paper reviews how these communities have\nevaluated interpretability, identifying overlaps and semantic misalignments. We\npropose moving towards a unified framework of evaluation criteria and lay the\ngroundwork for such a framework by articulating the relationships between\nexisting criteria. We argue that explanations serve as mediators between models\nand stakeholders, whether for intrinsically interpretable models or opaque\nblack-box models analyzed via post-hoc techniques. We further argue that useful\nexplanations require both faithfulness and intelligibility.

Meanwhile, self-supervised VOS methods have\nattempted to build VOS systems through correspondence learning and label\npropagation. Still, the absence of mask priors harms their robustness to\ncomplex scenarios, and the label propagation paradigm makes them impractical in\nterms of efficiency. To address these issues, we propose, for the first time, a\ngeneral one-shot training framework for VOS, requiring only a single labeled\nframe per training video and applicable to a majority of state-of-the-art VOS\nnetworks.

Through this\nbi-directional training, a satisfactory VOS network can be obtained. Notably,\nour approach is extremely simple and can be employed end-to-end.

        "abstract": "Training large Deep Neural Network (DNN) models requires thousands of GPUs\nfor days or weeks at a time. At these scales, failures are frequent and can\nhave a big impact on training throughput. Restoring performance using spare GPU\nservers becomes increasingly expensive as models grow. SlipStream is a system\nfor efficient DNN training in the presence of failures, without using spare\nservers. It exploits the functional redundancy inherent in distributed training\nsystems -- servers hold the same model parameters across data-parallel groups\n-- as well as the bubbles in the pipeline schedule within each data-parallel\ngroup. SlipStream dynamically re-routes the work of a failed server to its\ndata-parallel peers, ensuring continuous training despite multiple failures.\nHowever, re-routing work leads to imbalances across pipeline stages that\ndegrades training throughput. SlipStream introduces two optimizations that\nallow re-routed work to execute within bubbles of the original pipeline\nschedule. First, it decouples the backward pass computation into two phases.\nSecond, it staggers the execution of the optimizer step across pipeline stages.\nCombined, these optimizations enable schedules that minimize or even eliminate\ntraining throughput degradation during failures.

        "abstract": "Scaling laws have driven remarkable progress across machine learning domains\nlike language modeling and computer vision. However, the exploration of scaling\nlaws in embodied AI and robotics has been limited, despite the rapidly\nincreasing usage of machine learning in this field. This paper presents the\nfirst study to quantify scaling laws for Robot Foundation Models (RFMs) and the\nuse of LLMs in robotics tasks. Through a meta-analysis spanning 198 research\npapers, we analyze how key factors like compute, model size, and training data\nquantity impact model performance across various robotic tasks. Our findings\nconfirm that scaling laws apply to both RFMs and LLMs in robotics, with\nperformance consistently improving as resources increase. The power law\ncoefficients for RFMs closely match those of LLMs in robotics, resembling those\nfound in computer vision and outperforming those for LLMs in the language\ndomain. We also note that these coefficients vary with task complexity, with\nfamiliar tasks scaling more efficiently than unfamiliar ones, emphasizing the\nneed for large and diverse datasets. Furthermore, we highlight the absence of\nstandardized benchmarks in embodied AI. Most studies indicate diminishing\nreturns, suggesting that significant resources are necessary to achieve high\nperformance, posing challenges due to data and computational limitations.\nFinally, as models scale, we observe the emergence of new capabilities,\nparticularly related to data and model size.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence, machine learning (AI/ML) has allowed exploring\nsolutions for a variety of environmental and climate questions ranging from\nnatural disasters, greenhouse gas emission, monitoring biodiversity,\nagriculture, to weather and climate modeling, enabling progress towards climate\nchange mitigation. However, the intersection of AI/ML and environment is not\nalways positive. The recent surge of interest in ML, made possible by\nprocessing very large volumes of data, fueled by access to massive compute\npower, has sparked a trend towards large-scale adoption of AI/ML. This interest\nplaces tremendous pressure on natural resources, that are often overlooked and\nunder-reported. There is a need for a framework that monitors the environmental\nimpact and degradation from AI/ML throughout its lifecycle for informing\npolicymakers, stakeholders to adequately implement standards and policies and\ntrack the policy outcome over time. For these policies to be effective, AI's\nenvironmental impact needs to be monitored in a spatially-disaggregated, timely\nmanner across the globe at the key activity sites. This study proposes a\nmethodology to track environmental variables relating to the multifaceted\nimpact of AI around datacenters using openly available energy data and globally\nacquired satellite observations. We present a case study around Northern\nVirginia, United States that hosts a growing number of datacenters and observe\nchanges in multiple satellite-based environmental metrics. We then discuss the\nsteps to expand this methodology for comprehensive assessment of AI's\nenvironmental impact across the planet. We also identify data gaps and\nformulate recommendations for improving the understanding and monitoring\nAI-induced changes to the environment and climate.",

The standard, deterministic, semantics developed by Halpern\n(and based on the initial proposal of Galles & Pearl) assumes that for each\nassignment of values to parent variables there is a unique assignment to their\nchild variable, and it assumes that the actual world (an assignment of values\nto all variables of a model) specifies a unique counterfactual world for each\nintervention. Both assumptions are unrealistic, and therefore I drop both of\nthem in my proposal. I do so by allowing multi-valued functions in the\nstructural equations. In addition, I adjust the semantics so that the solutions\nto the equations that obtained in the actual world are preserved in any\ncounterfactual world. I motivate the resulting logic by comparing it to the\nstandard one by Halpern and to more recent proposals that are closer to mine.\nFinally, I extend these models to the probabilistic case and show that they\nopen up the way to identifying counterfactuals even in Causal Bayesian\nNetworks.",

        "abstract": "The performance of physical workers is significantly influenced by the\nquantity of their motions. However, monitoring and assessing these motions is\nchallenging due to the complexities of motion sensing, tracking, and\nquantification. Recent advancements have utilized in-situ video analysis for\nreal-time observation of worker behaviors, enabling data-driven quantification\nof motion amounts. Nevertheless, there are limitations to monitoring worker\nmovements using video data. This paper introduces a novel framework based on\ncomputer vision to track and quantify the motion of workers' upper and lower\nlimbs, issuing alerts when the motion reaches critical thresholds. Using joint\nposition data from posture estimation, the framework employs Hotelling's T$^2$\nstatistic to quantify and monitor motion amounts, integrating computer vision\ntools to address challenges in automated worker training and enhance\nexploratory research in this field. We collected data of participants\nperforming lifting and moving tasks with large boxes and small wooden cubes, to\nsimulate macro and micro assembly tasks respectively. It was found that the\ncorrelation between workers' joint motion amount and the Hotelling's T$^2$\nstatistic was approximately 35% greater for micro tasks compared to macro\ntasks, highlighting the framework's ability to identify fine-grained motion\ndifferences.

        "abstract": "The softmax gating function is arguably the most popular choice in mixture of\nexperts modeling. Despite its widespread use in practice, softmax gating may\nlead to unnecessary competition among experts, potentially causing the\nundesirable phenomenon of representation collapse due to its inherent\nstructure. In response, the sigmoid gating function has been recently proposed\nas an alternative and has been demonstrated empirically to achieve superior\nperformance. However, a rigorous examination of the sigmoid gating function is\nlacking in current literature. In this paper, we verify theoretically that\nsigmoid gating, in fact, enjoys a higher sample efficiency than softmax gating\nfor the statistical task of expert estimation. Towards that goal, we consider a\nregression framework in which the unknown regression function is modeled as a\nmixture of experts, and study the rates of convergence of the least squares\nestimator in the over-specified case in which the number of experts fitted is\nlarger than the true value. We show that two gating regimes naturally arise\nand, in each of them, we formulate identifiability conditions for the expert\nfunctions and derive the corresponding convergence rates. In both cases, we\nfind that experts formulated as feed-forward networks with commonly used\nactivation such as $\\mathrm{ReLU}$ and $\\mathrm{GELU}$ enjoy faster convergence\nrates under sigmoid gating than softmax gating. Furthermore, given the same\nchoice of experts, we demonstrate that the sigmoid gating function requires a\nsmaller sample size than its softmax counterpart to attain the same error of\nexpert estimation and, therefore, is more sample efficient.",

        "abstract": "Gait abnormality detection is critical for the early discovery and\nprogressive tracking of musculoskeletal and neurological disorders, such as\nParkinson's and Cerebral Palsy. Especially, analyzing the foot-floor contacts\nduring walking provides important insights into gait patterns, such as contact\narea, contact force, and contact time, enabling gait abnormality detection\nthrough these measurements. Existing studies use various sensing devices to\ncapture such information, including cameras, wearables, and force plates.\nHowever, the former two lack force-related information, making it difficult to\nidentify the causes of gait health issues, while the latter has limited\ncoverage of the walking path. In this study, we leverage footstep-induced\nstructural vibrations to infer foot-floor contact profiles and detect gait\nabnormalities. The main challenge lies in modeling the complex force transfer\nmechanism between the foot and the floor surfaces, leading to difficulty in\nreconstructing the force and contact profile during foot-floor interaction\nusing structural vibrations. To overcome the challenge, we first characterize\nthe floor vibration for each contact type (e.g., heel, midfoot, and toe\ncontact) to understand how contact forces and areas affect the induced floor\nvibration. Then, we leverage the time-frequency response spectrum resulting\nfrom those contacts to develop features that are representative of each contact\ntype. Finally, gait abnormalities are detected by comparing the predicted\nfoot-floor contact force and motion with the healthy gait. To evaluate our\napproach, we conducted a real-world walking experiment with 8 subjects. Our\napproach achieves 91.6% and 96.7% accuracy in predicting contact type and time,\nrespectively, leading to 91.9% accuracy in detecting various types of gait\nabnormalities, including asymmetry, dragging, and midfoot/toe contacts.",

        "abstract": "High-resolution images offer more information about scenes that can improve\nmodel accuracy. However, the dominant model architecture in computer vision,\nthe vision transformer (ViT), cannot effectively leverage larger images without\nfinetuning -- ViTs poorly extrapolate to more patches at test time, although\ntransformers offer sequence length flexibility. We attribute this shortcoming\nto the current patch position encoding methods, which create a distribution\nshift when extrapolating.\n  We propose a drop-in replacement for the position encoding of plain ViTs that\nrestricts attention heads to fixed fields of view, pointed in different\ndirections, using 2D attention masks. Our novel method, called LookHere,\nprovides translation-equivariance, ensures attention head diversity, and limits\nthe distribution shift that attention heads face when extrapolating. We\ndemonstrate that LookHere improves performance on classification (avg. 1.6%),\nagainst adversarial attack (avg. 5.4%), and decreases calibration error (avg.\n1.5%) -- on ImageNet without extrapolation. With extrapolation, LookHere\noutperforms the current SoTA position encoding method, 2D-RoPE, by 21.7% on\nImageNet when trained at $224^2$ px and tested at $1024^2$ px.

        "abstract": "The efficiency of classical Autoencoders (AEs) is limited in many practical\nsituations. When the latent space is reduced through autoencoders, feature\nextraction becomes possible. However, overfitting is a common issue, leading to\n``holes'' in AEs' interpolation capabilities. On the other hand, increasing the\nlatent dimension results in a better approximation with fewer non-linearly\ncoupled features (e.g., Koopman theory or kPCA), but it doesn't necessarily\nlead to dimensionality reduction, which makes feature extraction problematic.\nAs a result, interpolating using Autoencoders gets harder. In this work, we\nintroduce the Rank Reduction Autoencoder (RRAE), an autoencoder with an\nenlarged latent space, which is constrained to have a small pre-specified\nnumber of dominant singular values (i.e., low-rank). The latent space of RRAEs\nis large enough to enable accurate predictions while enabling feature\nextraction. As a result, the proposed autoencoder features a minimal rank\nlinear latent space. To achieve what's proposed, two formulations are\npresented, a strong and a weak one, that build a reduced basis accurately\nrepresenting the latent space. The first formulation consists of a truncated\nSVD in the latent space, while the second one adds a penalty term to the loss\nfunction.

        "abstract": "State-space models (SSMs) that utilize linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems\nare known for their effectiveness in learning long sequences. However, these\nmodels typically face several challenges: (i) they require specifically\ndesigned initializations of the system matrices to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance, (ii) they require training of state matrices on a logarithmic\nscale with very small learning rates to prevent instabilities, and (iii) they\nrequire the model to have exponentially decaying memory in order to ensure an\nasymptotically stable LTI system. To address these issues, we view SSMs through\nthe lens of Hankel operator theory, which provides us with a unified theory for\nthe initialization and training of SSMs. Building on this theory, we develop a\nnew parameterization scheme, called HOPE, for LTI systems that utilizes Markov\nparameters within Hankel operators. This approach allows for random\ninitializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability,\nwhile also provides the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities. Our model\nefficiently implements these innovations by nonuniformly sampling the transfer\nfunctions of LTI systems, and it requires fewer parameters compared to\ncanonical SSMs. When benchmarked against HiPPO-initialized models such as S4\nand S4D, an SSM parameterized by Hankel operators demonstrates improved\nperformance on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks.

Grounded on theory from factor analysis, DeTox is a\nsample-efficient model editing approach that identifies a toxic subspace in the\nmodel parameter space and reduces model toxicity by projecting away the\ndetected subspace. The toxic sub-space is identified by extracting preference\ndata embeddings from the language model, and removing non-toxic information\nfrom these embeddings. We show that DeTox is more sample-efficient than DPO,\nfurther showcasing greater robustness to noisy data. Finally, we establish both\ntheoretical and empirical connections between DeTox and DPO, showing that DeTox\ncan be interpreted as a denoised version of a single DPO step.",

        "abstract": "The reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain a topic of\ndebate. Some methods such as ReAct-based prompting, have gained popularity for\nclaiming to enhance sequential decision-making abilities of agentic LLMs.\nHowever, it is unclear what is the source of improvement in LLM reasoning with\nReAct based prompting. In this paper we examine these claims of ReAct based\nprompting in improving agentic LLMs for sequential decision-making. By\nintroducing systematic variations to the input prompt we perform a sensitivity\nanalysis along the claims of ReAct and find that the performance is minimally\ninfluenced by the \"interleaving reasoning trace with action execution\" or the\ncontent of the generated reasoning traces in ReAct, contrary to original claims\nand common usage. Instead, the performance of LLMs is driven by the similarity\nbetween input example tasks and queries, implicitly forcing the prompt designer\nto provide instance-specific examples which significantly increases the\ncognitive burden on the human. Our investigation shows that the perceived\nreasoning abilities of LLMs stem from the exemplar-query similarity and\napproximate retrieval rather than any inherent reasoning abilities.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13965v1",
        "abstract": "Modern power grids are undergoing significant changes driven by information\nand communication technologies (ICTs), and evolving into smart grids with\nhigher efficiency and lower operation cost. Using ICTs, however, comes with an\ninevitable side effect that makes the power system more vulnerable to cyber\nattacks. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning-based framework\nto detect and identify various types of cyber attacks. Different from existing\napproaches, the proposed framework does not rely on large amounts of\nwell-curated labeled data but makes use of the massive unlabeled data in the\nwild which are easily accessible. Specifically, the proposed framework adopts\nthe BERT model from the natural language processing domain and learns\ngeneralizable and effective representations from the unlabeled sensing data,\nwhich capture the distinctive patterns of different attacks. Using the learned\nrepresentations, together with a very small amount of labeled data, we can\ntrain a task-specific classifier to detect various types of cyber attacks.\nMeanwhile, real-world training datasets are usually imbalanced, i.e., there are\nonly a limited number of data samples containing attacks. In order to cope with\nsuch data imbalance, we propose a new loss function, separate mean error (SME),\nwhich pays equal attention to the large and small categories to better train\nthe model. Experiment results in a 5-area power grid system with 37 buses\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our framework over existing approaches,\nespecially when a very limited portion of labeled data are available, e.g., as\nlow as 0.002\\%. We believe such a framework can be easily adopted to detect a\nvariety of cyber attacks in other power grid scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to maximize a black-box objective\nfunction using only an offline dataset of designs and scores. A prevalent\napproach involves training a conditional generative model on existing designs\nand their associated scores, followed by the generation of new designs\nconditioned on higher target scores. However, these newly generated designs\noften underperform due to the lack of high-scoring training data. To address\nthis challenge, we introduce a novel method, Design Editing for Offline\nModel-based Optimization (DEMO), which consists of two phases. In the first\nphase, termed pseudo-target distribution generation, we apply gradient ascent\non the offline dataset using a trained surrogate model, producing a synthetic\ndataset where the predicted scores serve as new labels. A conditional diffusion\nmodel is subsequently trained on this synthetic dataset to capture a\npseudo-target distribution, which enhances the accuracy of the conditional\ndiffusion model in generating higher-scoring designs. Nevertheless, the\npseudo-target distribution is susceptible to noise stemming from inaccuracies\nin the surrogate model, consequently predisposing the conditional diffusion\nmodel to generate suboptimal designs. We hence propose the second phase,\nexisting design editing, to directly incorporate the high-scoring features from\nthe offline dataset into design generation. In this phase, top designs from the\noffline dataset are edited by introducing noise, which are subsequently refined\nusing the conditional diffusion model to produce high-scoring designs. Overall,\nhigh-scoring designs begin with inheriting high-scoring features from the\nsecond phase and are further refined with a more accurate conditional diffusion\nmodel in the first phase. Empirical evaluations on 7 offline MBO tasks show\nthat DEMO outperforms various baseline methods.",

In this paper, we jointly tackle these two-fold\npractical challenges by proposing SADDLe, a set of sharpness-aware\ndecentralized deep learning algorithms.

To address these challenges, this study introduces a\nframework that leverages data collected using wearable neurophysiological\nsensors on VRUs to integrate them seamlessly into the Vehicle-to-Everything\ncommunication framework. This integration empowers VRUs to autonomously\nbroadcast their intended movements to other road agents, especially autonomous\nvehicles, thereby bridging a critical gap in current vehicular communication\nsystems. To validate this concept, we conducted an experiment involving 12\nparticipants, from whom EEG signals were collected as they engaged in\nroad-crossing decisions within simulated environments. Employing Hidden Markov\nModels, we identified four cognitive stages intrinsic to a pedestrian's\ndecision-making process. Our statistical analysis further revealed significant\nvariations in EEG activities across these stages, shedding light on the neural\ncorrelates and cognitive dynamics underpinning pedestrian road-crossing\nbehavior. We then developed a predictive cognitive model using dynamic time\nwarping and K-nearest neighbors algorithms, optimized through a data-driven\nsliding window approach. This model demonstrated high predictive accuracy,\nevidenced by an Area Under the Curve of 0.91, indicating its capability to\nanticipate pedestrian road-crossing actions approximately 1 second in advance\nof any pedestrian movement.

Nevertheless, applying existing data valuation methods to recent LLMs\nand their vast training datasets has been largely limited by prohibitive\ncompute and memory costs. In this work, we focus on influence functions, a\npopular gradient-based data valuation method, and significantly improve its\nscalability with an efficient gradient projection strategy called LoGra that\nleverages the gradient structure in backpropagation. We then provide a\ntheoretical motivation of gradient projection approaches to influence functions\nto promote trust in the data valuation process. Lastly, we lower the barrier to\nimplementing data valuation systems by introducing LogIX, a software package\nthat can transform existing training code into data valuation code with minimal\neffort. In our data valuation experiments, LoGra achieves competitive accuracy\nagainst more expensive baselines while showing up to 6,500x improvement in\nthroughput and 5x reduction in GPU memory usage when applied to\nLlama3-8B-Instruct and the 1B-token dataset.",

        "abstract": "We propose an actor-critic algorithm for a family of complex problems arising\nin algebraic statistics and discrete optimization. The core task is to produce\na sample from a finite subset of the non-negative integer lattice defined by a\nhigh-dimensional polytope. We translate the problem into a Markov decision\nprocess and devise an actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to\nlearn a set of good moves that can be used for sampling. We prove that the\nactor-critic algorithm converges to an approximately optimal sampling policy.\n  To tackle complexity issues that typically arise in these sampling problems,\nand to allow the RL to function at scale, our solution strategy takes three\nsteps: decomposing the starting point of the sample, using RL on each induced\nsubproblem, and reconstructing to obtain a sample in the original polytope. In\nthis setup, the proof of convergence applies to each subproblem in the\ndecomposition.\n  We test the method in two regimes. In statistical applications, a\nhigh-dimensional polytope arises as the support set for the reference\ndistribution in a model/data fit test for a broad family of statistical models\nfor categorical data. We demonstrate how RL can be used for model fit testing\nproblems for data sets for which traditional MCMC samplers converge too slowly\ndue to problem size and sparsity structure. To test the robustness of the\nalgorithm and explore its generalization properties, we apply it to\nsynthetically generated data of various sizes and sparsity levels.",

        "abstract": "Visual Question Answering (VQA) within the surgical domain, utilizing Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), offers a distinct opportunity to improve\nintra-operative decision-making and facilitate intuitive surgeon-AI\ninteraction. However, the development of LLMs for surgical VQA is hindered by\nthe scarcity of diverse and extensive datasets with complex reasoning tasks.\nMoreover, contextual fusion of the image and text modalities remains an open\nresearch challenge due to the inherent differences between these two types of\ninformation and the complexity involved in aligning them. This paper introduces\nPitVQA, a novel dataset specifically designed for VQA in endonasal pituitary\nsurgery and PitVQA-Net, an adaptation of the GPT2 with a novel image-grounded\ntext embedding for surgical VQA. PitVQA comprises 25 procedural videos and a\nrich collection of question-answer pairs spanning crucial surgical aspects such\nas phase and step recognition, context understanding, tool detection and\nlocalization, and tool-tissue interactions. PitVQA-Net consists of a novel\nimage-grounded text embedding that projects image and text features into a\nshared embedding space and GPT2 Backbone with an excitation block\nclassification head to generate contextually relevant answers within the\ncomplex domain of endonasal pituitary surgery. Our image-grounded text\nembedding leverages joint embedding, cross-attention and contextual\nrepresentation to understand the contextual relationship between questions and\nsurgical images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PitVQA-Net on both the\nPitVQA and the publicly available EndoVis18-VQA dataset, achieving improvements\nin balanced accuracy of 8% and 9% over the most recent baselines, respectively.\nOur code and dataset is available at https://github.com/mobarakol/PitVQA.",

        "abstract": "The recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) show promising results on\nthe novel view synthesis (NVS) task. With its superior rendering performance\nand high-fidelity rendering quality, 3DGS is excelling at its previous NeRF\ncounterparts. The most recent 3DGS method focuses either on improving the\ninstability of rendering efficiency or reducing the model size. On the other\nhand, the training efficiency of 3DGS on large-scale scenes has not gained much\nattention. In this work, we propose DoGaussian, a method that trains 3DGS\ndistributedly. Our method first decomposes a scene into K blocks and then\nintroduces the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) into the\ntraining procedure of 3DGS. During training, our DoGaussian maintains one\nglobal 3DGS model on the master node and K local 3DGS models on the slave\nnodes. The K local 3DGS models are dropped after training and we only query the\nglobal 3DGS model during inference. The training time is reduced by scene\ndecomposition, and the training convergence and stability are guaranteed\nthrough the consensus on the shared 3D Gaussians. Our method accelerates the\ntraining of 3DGS by 6+ times when evaluated on large-scale scenes while\nconcurrently achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel bio-mimetic approach for distributed control of\nrobotic swarms, inspired by the collective behaviors of swarms in nature such\nas schools of fish and flocks of birds. The agents are assumed to have limited\nsensory perception, lack memory, be Identical, anonymous, and operate without\ninteragent explicit communication. Despite these limitations, we demonstrate\nthat collaborative exploration and task allocation can be executed by applying\nsimple local rules of interactions between the agents. A comprehensive model\ncomprised of agent, formation, and swarm layers is proposed in this paper,\nwhere each layer performs a specific function in shaping the swarm's collective\nbehavior, thereby contributing to the emergence of the anticipated behaviors.\nWe consider four principles combined in the design of the distributed control\nprocess: Cohesiveness, Flexibility, Attraction-Repulsion, and Peristaltic\nMotion. We design the control algorithms as reactive behaviour that enables the\nswarm to maintain connectivity, adapt to dynamic environments, spread out and\ncover a region with a size determined by the number of agents, and respond to\nvarious local task requirements. We explore some simple broadcast control-based\nsteering methods, that result in inducing \"anonymous ad-hoc leaders\" among the\nagents, capable of guiding the swarm towards yet unexplored regions with\nfurther tasks. Our analysis is complemented by simulations, validating the\nefficacy of our algorithms. The experiments with various scenarios showcase the\nswarm`s capability to self-organize and perform tasks effectively under the\nproposed framework.

We find that XMPU security\npolicy protects user memory from unauthorized access when the user is active.\nHowever, when a user's session is terminated, the contents of the memory region\nof the terminated process are not cleared. An attacker can exploit this\nvulnerability by gaining access to the memory region after it has been\nreassigned. The attacker can read the data from the previous user's memory\nregion, thereby compromising the confidentiality. To prevent the Resurrection\nAttack, the memory region of a terminated process must be cleared. However,\nthis is not the case in the XMPU implementation, which allows our attack to\nsucceed.

Presenting such buggy code to users can impact their\nreliability and trust in LLM-based assistants. Moreover, significant efforts\nare required by the user to detect and repair any bug present in the code,\nespecially if no test cases are available. In this study, we propose a\nself-refinement method aimed at improving the reliability of code generated by\nLLMs by minimizing the number of bugs before execution, without human\nintervention, and in the absence of test cases. Our approach is based on\ntargeted Verification Questions (VQs) to identify potential bugs within the\ninitial code. These VQs target various nodes within the Abstract Syntax Tree\n(AST) of the initial code, which have the potential to trigger specific types\nof bug patterns commonly found in LLM-generated code. Finally, our method\nattempts to repair these potential bugs by re-prompting the LLM with the\ntargeted VQs and the initial code. Our evaluation, based on programming tasks\nin the CoderEval dataset, demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by decreasing the number of targeted errors in the\ncode between 21% to 62% and improving the number of executable code instances\nto 13%.",

The methodology follows a\npreviously determined problem ontology, where physical, functional and modeling\narchitectures are decided upon. By carrying out sensitivity analysis techniques\nutilizing system-level tools, critical epistemic uncertainties can be\nidentified.

        "abstract": "There has been a surge in the development of various Large Language Models\n(LLMs). However, text generation for languages other than English often faces\nsignificant challenges, including poor generation quality and the reduced\ncomputational performance due to the disproportionate representation of tokens\nin model's vocabulary. In this work, we address these issues and introduce\nVikhr, a new state-of-the-art open-source instruction-tuned LLM designed\nspecifically for the Russian language. Unlike previous efforts for Russian that\nutilize computationally inexpensive LoRA adapters on top of English-oriented\nmodels, Vikhr features an adapted tokenizer vocabulary and undergoes the\ncontinued pre-training and instruction tuning of all weights. This approach not\nonly enhances the model's performance but also significantly improves its\ncomputational and contextual efficiency. The remarkable performance of Vikhr\nacross various Russian-language benchmarks can also be attributed to our\nefforts in expanding instruction datasets and corpora for continued\npre-training. Vikhr not only sets the new state of the art among open-source\nLLMs for Russian, but even outperforms some proprietary closed-source models on\ncertain benchmarks.

        "abstract": "FPGA-based hardware accelerators are becoming increasingly popular due to\ntheir versatility, customizability, energy efficiency, constant latency, and\nscalability. FPGAs can be tailored to specific algorithms, enabling efficient\nhardware implementations that effectively leverage algorithm parallelism. This\ncan lead to significant performance improvements over CPUs and GPUs,\nparticularly for highly parallel applications. For example, a recent study\nfound that Stratix 10 FPGAs can achieve up to 90\\% of the performance of a\nTitanX Pascal GPU while consuming less than 50\\% of the power. This makes FPGAs\nan attractive choice for accelerating machine learning (ML) workloads. However,\nour research finds privacy and security vulnerabilities in existing Xilinx\nFPGA-based hardware acceleration solutions. These vulnerabilities arise from\nthe lack of memory initialization and insufficient process isolation, which\ncreates potential avenues for unauthorized access to private data used by\nprocesses. To illustrate this issue, we conducted experiments using a Xilinx\nZCU104 board running the PetaLinux tool from Xilinx. We found that PetaLinux\ndoes not effectively clear memory locations associated with a terminated\nprocess, leaving them vulnerable to memory scraping attack (MSA). This paper\nmakes two main contributions. The first contribution is an attack methodology\nof using the Xilinx debugger from a different user space. We find that we are\nable to access process IDs, virtual address spaces, and pagemaps of one user\nfrom a different user space because of lack of adequate process isolation. The\nsecond contribution is a methodology for characterizing terminated processes\nand accessing their private data. We illustrate this on Xilinx ML application\nlibrary.",

        "abstract": "The scarcity of non-English data limits the development of non-English large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Transforming English-centric LLMs to non-English has\nbeen identified as an effective and resource-efficient method. Previous works\nstart from base LLMs and perform knowledge distillation (KD) with data\ngenerated by stronger LLMs, e.g. GPT-4. Compared to base LLMs, chat LLMs are\nfurther optimized for advanced abilities, e.g. multi-turn conversation and\nhuman preference alignment, and thus more powerful in both helpfulness and\nsafety. However, transforming a chat LLM involves two critical issues: (1) How\ncan we effectively transfer advanced abilities without their supervised data?\n(2) How can we prevent the original knowledge from catastrophic forgetting\nduring transformation? We target these issues by introducing a simple framework\ncalled TransLLM. For the first issue, TransLLM divides the transfer problem\ninto some common sub-tasks with the translation chain-of-thought, which uses\nthe translation as the bridge between English and non-English step-by-step. We\nfurther enhance the performance of sub-tasks with publicly available data. For\nthe second issue, we propose a method comprising two synergistic components:\nlow-rank adaptation for training to maintain the original LLM parameters, and\nrecovery KD, which utilizes data generated by the chat LLM itself to recover\nthe original knowledge from the frozen parameters. In the experiments, we\ntransform the LLaMA-2-chat-7B to the Thai language. Our method, using only\nsingle-turn data, outperforms strong baselines and ChatGPT on multi-turn\nbenchmark MT-bench. Furthermore, our method, without safety data, rejects more\nharmful queries of safety benchmark AdvBench than both ChatGPT and GPT-4.",

If the\nprice is lower than the buyers' valuation and higher than the sellers'\nvaluation, then a trade takes place. Previous work focused on the platform\nperspective, with the goal of setting prices maximizing the gain from trade\n(the sum of sellers' and buyers' utilities). Gain from trade is, however,\npotentially unfair to traders, as they may receive highly uneven shares of the\ntotal utility. In this work we enforce fairness by rewarding the platform with\nthe fair gain from trade, defined as the minimum between sellers' and buyers'\nutilities. After showing that any no-regret learning algorithm designed to\nmaximize the sum of the utilities may fail badly with fair gain from trade, we\npresent our main contribution: a complete characterization of the regret\nregimes for fair gain from trade when, after each interaction, the platform\nonly learns whether each trader accepted the current price. Specifically, we\nprove the following regret bounds: $\\Theta(\\ln T)$ in the deterministic\nsetting, $\\Omega(T)$ in the stochastic setting, and $\\tilde{\\Theta}(T^{2/3})$\nin the stochastic setting when sellers' and buyers' valuations are independent\nof each other.

On top of this, most of\nthe literature has focused on the special case of estimating the left singular\nvector of the signal when the noise only possesses row correlation (one-sided\nheteroscedasticity). In contrast, our work establishes the\ninformation-theoretic and algorithmic limits of matrix denoising with doubly\nheteroscedastic noise.

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in image understanding have benefited from the extensive\nuse of web image-text pairs. However, video understanding remains a challenge\ndespite the availability of substantial web video-text data. This difficulty\nprimarily arises from the inherent complexity of videos and the inefficient\nlanguage supervision in recent web-collected video-text datasets. In this\npaper, we introduce Text-Only Pre-Alignment (TOPA), a novel approach to extend\nlarge language models (LLMs) for video understanding, without the need for\npre-training on real video data. Specifically, we first employ an advanced LLM\nto automatically generate Textual Videos comprising continuous textual frames,\nalong with corresponding annotations to simulate real video-text data. Then,\nthese annotated textual videos are used to pre-align a language-only LLM with\nthe video modality. To bridge the gap between textual and real videos, we\nemploy the CLIP model as the feature extractor to align image and text\nmodalities. During text-only pre-alignment, the continuous textual frames,\nencoded as a sequence of CLIP text features, are analogous to continuous CLIP\nimage features, thus aligning the LLM with real video representation. Extensive\nexperiments, including zero-shot evaluation and finetuning on various video\nunderstanding tasks, demonstrate that TOPA is an effective and efficient\nframework for aligning video content with LLMs. In particular, without training\non any video data, the TOPA-Llama2-13B model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 51.0%\non the challenging long-form video understanding benchmark, Egoschema. This\nperformance surpasses previous video-text pre-training approaches and proves\ncompetitive with recent GPT-3.5-based video agents.",

        "abstract": "This work studies the learning problem of the energy-based prior model and\nthe multi-layer generator model. The multi-layer generator model, which\ncontains multiple layers of latent variables organized in a top-down\nhierarchical structure, typically assumes the Gaussian prior model. Such a\nprior model can be limited in modelling expressivity, which results in a gap\nbetween the generator posterior and the prior model, known as the prior hole\nproblem. Recent works have explored learning the energy-based (EBM) prior model\nas a second-stage, complementary model to bridge the gap. However, the EBM\ndefined on a multi-layer latent space can be highly multi-modal, which makes\nsampling from such marginal EBM prior challenging in practice, resulting in\nineffectively learned EBM. To tackle the challenge, we propose to leverage the\ndiffusion probabilistic scheme to mitigate the burden of EBM sampling and thus\nfacilitate EBM learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate a superior\nperformance of our diffusion-learned EBM prior on various challenging tasks.",

These closed-source large-language models typically see the widest\nusage by the public, however, they often do not provide an estimate of their\nuncertainty when responding to queries. As even the best models are prone to\n``hallucinating\" false information with high confidence, a lack of a reliable\nestimate of uncertainty limits the applicability of these models in critical\nsettings. We explore estimating the uncertainty of closed-source LLMs via\nmultiple rephrasings of an original base query. Specifically, we ask the model,\nmultiple rephrased questions, and use the similarity of the answers as an\nestimate of uncertainty. We diverge from previous work in i) providing rules\nfor rephrasing that are simple to memorize and use in practice ii) proposing a\ntheoretical framework for why multiple rephrased queries obtain calibrated\nuncertainty estimates.

        "abstract": "Understanding how genetically encoded rules drive and guide complex neuronal\ngrowth processes is essential to comprehending the brain's architecture, and\nagent-based models (ABMs) offer a powerful simulation approach to further\ndevelop this understanding. However, accurately calibrating these models\nremains a challenge. Here, we present a novel application of Approximate\nBayesian Computation (ABC) to address this issue. ABMs are based on\nparametrized stochastic rules that describe the time evolution of small\ncomponents -- the so-called agents -- discretizing the system, leading to\nstochastic simulations that require appropriate treatment. Mathematically, the\ncalibration defines a stochastic inverse problem. We propose to address it in a\nBayesian setting using ABC. We facilitate the repeated comparison between data\nand simulations by quantifying the morphological information of single neurons\nwith so-called morphometrics and resort to statistical distances to measure\ndiscrepancies between populations thereof. We conduct experiments on synthetic\nas well as experimental data. We find that ABC utilizing Sequential Monte Carlo\nsampling and the Wasserstein distance finds accurate posterior parameter\ndistributions for representative ABMs. We further demonstrate that these ABMs\ncapture specific features of pyramidal cells of the hippocampus (CA1).

However, training the attention weights of\nqueries, keys, and values is non-trivial from a state of random initialization.\nIn this paper, we propose two methods. (i) We first address the initialization\nproblem of Vision Transformers by introducing a simple, yet highly innovative,\ninitialization approach utilizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients.\nOur proposed DCT-based attention initialization marks a significant gain\ncompared to traditional initialization strategies; offering a robust foundation\nfor the attention mechanism. Our experiments reveal that the DCT-based\ninitialization enhances the accuracy of Vision Transformers in classification\ntasks. (ii) We also recognize that since DCT effectively decorrelates image\ninformation in the frequency domain, this decorrelation is useful for\ncompression because it allows the quantization step to discard many of the\nhigher-frequency components. Based on this observation, we propose a novel\nDCT-based compression technique for the attention function of Vision\nTransformers. Since high-frequency DCT coefficients usually correspond to\nnoise, we truncate the high-frequency DCT components of the input patches. Our\nDCT-based compression reduces the size of weight matrices for queries, keys,\nand values.

These approaches often require retraining/fine-tuning using a few\nimages, leading to time-consuming training processes and impeding their swift\nimplementation. Furthermore, the reliance on multiple images to represent a\nsingular concept increases the difficulty of customization.

However, while MPS can\nensure safety both during and after training, it often hinders task progress\ndue to the conservative and task-oblivious nature of backup policies. This\npaper introduces Dynamic Model Predictive Shielding (DMPS), which optimizes\nreinforcement learning objectives while maintaining provable safety. DMPS\nemploys a local planner to dynamically select safe recovery actions that\nmaximize both short-term progress as well as long-term rewards. Crucially, the\nplanner and the neural policy play a synergistic role in DMPS. When planning\nrecovery actions for ensuring safety, the planner utilizes the neural policy to\nestimate long-term rewards, allowing it to observe beyond its short-term\nplanning horizon. Conversely, the neural policy under training learns from the\nrecovery plans proposed by the planner, converging to policies that are both\nhigh-performing and safe in practice. This approach guarantees safety during\nand after training, with bounded recovery regret that decreases exponentially\nwith planning horizon depth. Experimental results demonstrate that DMPS\nconverges to policies that rarely require shield interventions after training\nand achieve higher rewards compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "abstract": "When companies release marketing materials aimed at promoting their privacy\npractices or highlighting specific privacy features, what do they actually\ncommunicate to consumers? In this paper, we explore the impact of privacy\nmarketing materials on: (1) consumers' attitude towards the organizations\nproviding the campaigns, (2) overall privacy awareness, and (3) the\nactionability of suggested privacy advice. To this end, we investigated the\nimpact of four privacy advertising videos and one privacy game published by\nfive different technology companies. We conducted 24 semi-structured interviews\nwith participants randomly assigned to view one or two of the videos or play\nthe game. Our findings suggest that awareness of privacy features can\ncontribute to positive perceptions of a company or its products. The ads we\ntested were more successful in communicating the advertised privacy features\nthan the game we tested. We observed that advertising a single privacy feature\nusing a single metaphor in a short ad increased awareness of the advertised\nfeature. The game failed to communicate privacy features or motivate study\nparticipants to use the features. Our results also suggest that privacy\ncampaigns can be useful for raising awareness about privacy features and\nimproving brand image, but may not be the most effective way to teach viewers\nhow to use privacy features.",

        "abstract": "Predicting potential long-time contributors (LTCs) early allows project\nmaintainers to effectively allocate resources and mentoring to enhance their\ndevelopment and retention. Mapping programming language expertise to developers\nand characterizing projects in terms of how they use programming languages can\nhelp identify developers who are more likely to become LTCs. However, prior\nstudies on predicting LTCs do not consider programming language skills. This\npaper reports an empirical study on the usage of knowledge units (KUs) of the\nJava programming language to predict LTCs. A KU is a cohesive set of key\ncapabilities that are offered by one or more building blocks of a given\nprogramming language. We build a prediction model called KULTC, which leverages\nKU-based features along five different dimensions. We detect and analyze KUs\nfrom the studied 75 Java projects (353K commits and 168K pull requests) as well\nas 4,219 other Java projects in which the studied developers previously worked\n(1.7M commits). We compare the performance of KULTC with the state-of-the-art\nmodel, which we call BAOLTC. Even though KULTC focuses exclusively on the\nprogramming language perspective, KULTC achieves a median AUC of at least 0.75\nand significantly outperforms BAOLTC. Combining the features of KULTC with the\nfeatures of BAOLTC results in an enhanced model (KULTC+BAOLTC) that\nsignificantly outperforms BAOLTC with a normalized AUC improvement of 16.5%.\nOur feature importance analysis with SHAP reveals that developer expertise in\nthe studied project is the most influential feature dimension for predicting\nLTCs. Finally, we develop a cost-effective model (KULTC_DEV_EXP+BAOLTC) that\nsignificantly outperforms BAOLTC. These encouraging results can be helpful to\nresearchers who wish to further study the developers' engagement/retention to\nFLOSS projects or build models for predicting LTCs.",

        "abstract": "With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to various\ndomains, concerns regarding the trustworthiness of LLMs in safety-critical\nscenarios have been raised, due to their unpredictable tendency to hallucinate\nand generate misinformation. Existing LLMs do not have an inherent\nfunctionality to provide the users with an uncertainty metric for each response\nit generates, making it difficult to evaluate trustworthiness. Although a\nnumber of works aim to develop uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs,\nthey have fundamental limitations, such as being restricted to classification\ntasks, requiring additional training and data, considering only lexical instead\nof semantic information, and being prompt-wise but not response-wise.

Our\nlanguage development is largely shaped by our social interactions, for example,\nthe demonstration and feedback from caregivers. Contrary to human language\nlearning, recent advancements in large language models have primarily adopted a\nnon-interactive training paradigm, and refined pre-trained models through\nfeedback afterward. In this work, we aim to examine how corrective feedback\nfrom interactions influences neural language acquisition from the ground up\nthrough systematically controlled experiments, assessing whether it contributes\nto learning efficiency in language models. We introduce a\ntrial-and-demonstration (TnD) learning framework that incorporates three\ncomponents: student trials, teacher demonstrations, and a reward conditioned on\nlanguage competence at various developmental stages. Our experiments reveal\nthat the TnD approach accelerates word acquisition for student models of equal\nand smaller numbers of parameters, and we highlight the significance of both\ntrials and demonstrations. We further show that the teacher's choices of words\ninfluence students' word-specific learning efficiency, and a\npractice-makes-perfect effect is evident by a strong correlation between the\nfrequency of words in trials and their respective learning curves. Our findings\nsuggest that interactive language learning, with teacher demonstrations and\nstudent trials, can facilitate efficient word learning in language models.",

        "abstract": "The problem of improving the handover performance in Long Term\nEvolution-Advanced (LTE-A) networks has not been fully solved yet.\nTraditionally, the selection of the target Evolved Node B (TeNB) in the\nhandover procedure is based on the signal strength measurements, which may not\nproduce a reliable handover. A reliable handover method may reduce the\ninstances of unstable or frequent handovers that otherwise waste network\nresources. The signal strength measurement process is inherently time consuming\nas the user equipment (UE) has to measure multiple neighboring eNB (NeNB)\nfrequencies in each measurement period. An efficient handover method is\nrequired to improve the overall performance of such systems. In this paper we\npropose a reliable and fast TeNB selection scheme for LTE-A handover. The\nproposed scheme outperforms the existing LTE-A handover methods. The improved\nperformance is achieved by selecting the TeNB based on some three independent\nparameters, namely orientation matching (OM), current load (CL), and the\nreceived signal strengths. An UE essentially measures only the NeNBs\nshortlisted based on OM and CL; thus measurement time is reduced considerably\nleading to a reduction of overall handover time. The performance of the\nproposed scheme is validated by simulation.",

        "abstract": "Given a text query, partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR) aims to\nretrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant moments. Due to the lack of\nmoment annotations, the uncertainty lying in clip modeling and text-clip\ncorrespondence leads to major challenges. Despite the great progress, existing\nsolutions either sacrifice efficiency or efficacy to capture varying and\nuncertain video moments. What's worse, few methods have paid attention to the\ntext-clip matching pattern under such uncertainty, exposing the risk of\nsemantic collapse. To address these issues, we present GMMFormer v2, an\nuncertainty-aware framework for PRVR. For clip modeling, we improve a strong\nbaseline GMMFormer with a novel temporal consolidation module upon multi-scale\ncontextual features, which maintains efficiency and improves the perception for\nvarying moments. To achieve uncertainty-aware text-clip matching, we upgrade\nthe query diverse loss in GMMFormer to facilitate fine-grained uniformity and\npropose a novel optimal matching loss for fine-grained text-clip alignment.\nTheir collaboration alleviates the semantic collapse phenomenon and neatly\npromotes accurate correspondence between texts and moments. We conduct\nextensive experiments and ablation studies on three PRVR benchmarks,\ndemonstrating remarkable improvement of GMMFormer v2 compared to the past SOTA\ncompetitor and the versatility of uncertainty-aware text-clip matching for\nPRVR.

        "abstract": "In geostatistics, traditional spatial models often rely on the Gaussian\nProcess (GP) to fit stationary covariances to data.

A powerful class of\nmethods approximate the GP as a sum of basis functions with random\ncoefficients. Although this technique offers computational efficiency, it does\nnot inherently guarantee a stationary covariance. To mitigate this issue, the\nbasis functions can be \"normalized\" to maintain a constant marginal variance,\navoiding unwanted artifacts and edge effects. This allows for the fitting of\nnearly stationary models to large, potentially non-stationary datasets,\nproviding a rigorous base to extend to more complex problems.

Given an attacker's objective spanning from inferring a subset to the\nentirety of summary statistic secrets, we systematically design and analyze\ntailored privacy metrics. Defining the distortion as the worst-case distance\nbetween the original and released data distribution, we analyze the tradeoff\nbetween privacy and distortion. Our contribution also includes designing and\nanalyzing data release mechanisms tailored for different data distributions and\nsecret types. Evaluations on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour mechanisms in practical applications.",

The recent outstanding performance of MLLMs in\nmultimodal understanding has garnered broad attention from both academia and\nindustry.

We witness the rise of larger and higher-quality\ninstruction datasets, as well as the involvement of larger-sized LLMs. Yet,\nscant attention has been directed towards the visual signals utilized by MLLMs,\noften assumed to be the final high-level features extracted by a frozen visual\nencoder.

        "abstract": "Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models have made significant\nadvancements in weather forecasting, particularly in medium-range and\nnowcasting. However, most data-driven weather forecasting models are black-box\nsystems that focus on learning data mapping rather than fine-grained physical\nevolution in the time dimension. Consequently, the limitations in the temporal\nscale of datasets prevent these models from forecasting at finer time scales.\nThis paper proposes a physics-AI hybrid model (i.e., WeatherGFT) which\nGeneralizes weather forecasts to Finer-grained Temporal scales beyond training\ndataset. Specifically, we employ a carefully designed PDE kernel to simulate\nphysical evolution on a small time scale (e.g., 300 seconds) and use a parallel\nneural networks with a learnable router for bias correction. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a lead time-aware training framework to promote the generalization of\nthe model at different lead times. The weight analysis of physics-AI modules\nindicates that physics conducts major evolution while AI performs corrections\nadaptively. Extensive experiments show that WeatherGFT trained on an hourly\ndataset, achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple lead times and\nexhibits the capability to generalize 30-minute forecasts.",

In xRAG, the only trainable component is the\nmodality bridge, while both the retriever and the language model remain frozen.\nThis design choice allows for the reuse of offline-constructed document\nembeddings and preserves the plug-and-play nature of retrieval augmentation.\nExperimental results demonstrate that xRAG achieves an average improvement of\nover 10% across six knowledge-intensive tasks, adaptable to various language\nmodel backbones, ranging from a dense 7B model to an 8x7B Mixture of Experts\nconfiguration. xRAG not only significantly outperforms previous context\ncompression methods but also matches the performance of uncompressed models on\nseveral datasets, while reducing overall FLOPs by a factor of 3.53.

To gain insights into this phenomenon, we\nconcentrate on a single-neuron target recovery scenario, offering a systematic\nexamination of how initialization and sample size influence the performance of\ntwo-layer neural networks. Our experiments reveal that a smaller initialization\nscale is associated with improved generalization, and we identify a critical\nquantity called the \"initial imbalance ratio\" that governs training dynamics\nand generalization under small initialization, supported by theoretical proofs.\nAdditionally, we empirically delineate two critical thresholds in sample\nsize--termed the \"optimistic sample size\" and the \"separation sample\nsize\"--that align with the theoretical frameworks established by (see\narXiv:2307.08921 and arXiv:2309.00508). Our results indicate a transition in\nthe model's ability to recover the target function: below the optimistic sample\nsize, recovery is unattainable; at the optimistic sample size, recovery becomes\nattainable albeit with a set of initialization of zero measure. Upon reaching\nthe separation sample size, the set of initialization that can successfully\nrecover the target function shifts from zero to positive measure.

        "abstract": "Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is widely used in statistics and machine\nlearning for prediction tasks requiring uncertainty measures. Its efficacy\ndepends on the appropriate specification of the mean function, covariance\nkernel function, and associated hyperparameters. Severe misspecifications can\nlead to inaccurate results and problematic consequences, especially in\nsafety-critical applications. However, a systematic approach to handle these\nmisspecifications is lacking in the literature. In this work, we propose a\ngeneral framework to address these issues. Firstly, we introduce a flexible\ntwo-stage GPR framework that separates mean prediction and uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) to prevent mean misspecification, which can introduce bias\ninto the model. Secondly, kernel function misspecification is addressed through\na novel automatic kernel search algorithm, supported by theoretical analysis,\nthat selects the optimal kernel from a candidate set. Additionally, we propose\na subsampling-based warm-start strategy for hyperparameter initialization to\nimprove efficiency and avoid hyperparameter misspecification. With much lower\ncomputational cost, our subsampling-based strategy can yield competitive or\nbetter performance than training exclusively on the full dataset. Combining all\nthese components, we recommend two GPR methods-exact and scalable-designed to\nmatch available computational resources and specific UQ requirements.

        "abstract": "In the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, leveraging artificial\nintelligence to predict disease outcomes from chest radiographic images\nrepresents a significant scientific aim. The challenge, however, lies in the\nscarcity of large, labeled datasets with compatible tasks for training deep\nlearning models without leading to overfitting. Addressing this issue, we\nintroduce a novel multi-dataset multi-task training framework that predicts\nCOVID-19 prognostic outcomes from chest X-rays (CXR) by integrating correlated\ndatasets from disparate sources, distant from conventional multi-task learning\napproaches, which rely on datasets with multiple and correlated labeling\nschemes. Our framework hypothesizes that assessing severity scores enhances the\nmodel's ability to classify prognostic severity groups, thereby improving its\nrobustness and predictive power. The proposed architecture comprises a deep\nconvolutional network that receives inputs from two publicly available CXR\ndatasets, AIforCOVID for severity prognostic prediction and BRIXIA for severity\nscore assessment, and branches into task-specific fully connected output\nnetworks. Moreover, we propose a multi-task loss function, incorporating an\nindicator function, to exploit multi-dataset integration. The effectiveness and\nrobustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through significant\nperformance improvements in prognosis classification tasks across 18 different\nconvolutional neural network backbones in different evaluation strategies. This\nimprovement is evident over single-task baselines and standard transfer\nlearning strategies, supported by extensive statistical analysis, showing great\napplication potential.",

We gathered Reddit data comprising 4.5 million comments from 31\nthousand posts in six different languages (Dutch, English, German, Arabic,\nTurkish and Spanish). We target fifteen major social and political world events\nthat occurred between 2020 and 2023.

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used in various applications,\nfrom recommendation systems in e-commerce to diagnosis prediction in\nhealthcare. In this paper, we present a novel dynamic framework for thinking\nabout the deployment of ML models in a performative, human-ML collaborative\nsystem. In our framework, the introduction of ML recommendations changes the\ndata generating process of human decisions, which are only a proxy to the\nground truth and which are then used to train future versions of the model. We\nshow that this dynamic process in principle can converge to different stable\npoints, i.e. where the ML model and the Human+ML system have the same\nperformance. Some of these stable points are suboptimal with respect to the\nactual ground truth. We conduct an empirical user study with 1,408 participants\nto showcase this process. In the study, humans solve instances of the knapsack\nproblem with the help of machine learning predictions. This is an ideal setting\nbecause we can see how ML models learn to imitate human decisions and how this\nlearning process converges to a stable point. We find that for many levels of\nML performance, humans can improve the ML predictions to dynamically reach an\nequilibrium performance that is around 92% of the maximum knapsack value. We\nalso find that the equilibrium performance could be even higher if humans\nrationally followed the ML recommendations. Finally, we test whether monetary\nincentives can increase the quality of human decisions, but we fail to find any\npositive effect. Our results have practical implications for the deployment of\nML models in contexts where human decisions may deviate from the indisputable\nground truth.",

Although VLMs demonstrate great\npotential in robotic task planning, they suffer from challenges like\nhallucination, semantic complexity, and limited context. To handle such issues,\nthis paper proposes a multi-agent framework, i.e., GameVLM, to enhance the\ndecision-making process in robotic task planning. In this study, VLM-based\ndecision and expert agents are presented to conduct the task planning.\nSpecifically, decision agents are used to plan the task, and the expert agent\nis employed to evaluate these task plans. Zero-sum game theory is introduced to\nresolve inconsistencies among different agents and determine the optimal\nsolution.

        "abstract": "The success of current Large-Language Models (LLMs) hinges on extensive\ntraining data that is collected and stored centrally, called Centralized\nLearning (CL). However, such a collection manner poses a privacy threat, and\none potential solution is Federated Learning (FL), which transfers gradients,\nnot raw data, among clients. Unlike traditional networks, FL for LLMs incurs\nsignificant communication costs due to their tremendous parameters. This study\nintroduces an innovative approach to compress gradients to improve\ncommunication efficiency during LLM FL, formulating the new FL pipeline named\nCG-FedLLM. This approach integrates an encoder on the client side to acquire\nthe compressed gradient features and a decoder on the server side to\nreconstruct the gradients. We also developed a novel training strategy that\ncomprises Temporal-ensemble Gradient-Aware Pre-training (TGAP) to identify\ncharacteristic gradients of the target model and Federated AutoEncoder-Involved\nFine-tuning (FAF) to compress gradients adaptively. Extensive experiments\nconfirm that our approach reduces communication costs and improves performance\n(e.g., average 3 points increment compared with traditional CL- and FL-based\nfine-tuning with LlaMA on a well-recognized benchmark, C-Eval). This\nimprovement is because our encoder-decoder, trained via TGAP and FAF, can\nfilter gradients while selectively preserving critical features. Furthermore,\nwe present a series of experimental analyses focusing on the signal-to-noise\nratio, compression rate, and robustness within this privacy-centric framework,\nproviding insight into developing more efficient and secure LLMs.",

By utilizing a neural SDF, we achieve a smooth\nrepresentation of the base surface, minimizing the impact of piecewise planar\ndiscretization and minor surface variations. Moreover, the principal curvatures\nand directions are fully encoded by the Hessian of the SDF, enabling the\nregularization of the overall cross field through minor adjustments to the SDF.\nCompared to state-of-the-art methods, NeurCross significantly improves the\nplacement of singular points and the approximation accuracy between the input\ntriangular surface and the output quad mesh, as demonstrated in the teaser\nfigure.",

In this work, we\nsystematically investigate the implicit regularization of matrix factorization\nfor solving matrix completion problems. We empirically discover that the\nconnectivity of observed data plays a crucial role in the implicit bias, with a\ntransition from low nuclear norm to low rank as data shifts from disconnected\nto connected with increased observations. We identify a hierarchy of intrinsic\ninvariant manifolds in the loss landscape that guide the training trajectory to\nevolve from low-rank to higher-rank solutions. Based on this finding, we\ntheoretically characterize the training trajectory as following the\nhierarchical invariant manifold traversal process, generalizing the\ncharacterization of Li et al.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13707v1",
        "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of large-scale graphs poses a significant challenge\nfor graph neural network training, attributed to their substantial\ncomputational requirements. In response, graph condensation (GC) emerges as a\npromising data-centric solution aiming to substitute the large graph with a\nsmall yet informative condensed graph to facilitate data-efficient GNN\ntraining. However, existing GC methods suffer from intricate optimization\nprocesses, necessitating excessive computing resources. In this paper, we\nrevisit existing GC optimization strategies and identify two pervasive issues:\n1. various GC optimization strategies converge to class-level node feature\nmatching between the original and condensed graphs, making the optimization\ntarget coarse-grained despite the complex computations; 2. to bridge the\noriginal and condensed graphs, existing GC methods rely on a Siamese graph\nnetwork architecture that requires time-consuming bi-level optimization with\niterative gradient computations. To overcome these issues, we propose a\ntraining-free GC framework termed Class-partitioned Graph Condensation (CGC),\nwhich refines the node feature matching from the class-to-class paradigm into a\nnovel class-to-node paradigm. Remarkably, this refinement also simplifies the\nGC optimization as a class partition problem, which can be efficiently solved\nby any clustering methods. Moreover, CGC incorporates a pre-defined graph\nstructure to enable a closed-form solution for condensed node features,\neliminating the back-and-forth gradient descent in existing GC approaches\nwithout sacrificing accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGC\nachieves state-of-the-art performance with a more efficient condensation\nprocess. For instance, compared with the seminal GC method (i.e., GCond), CGC\ncondenses the largest Reddit graph within 10 seconds, achieving a 2,680X\nspeedup and a 1.4% accuracy increase.",

        "abstract": "We show that weights learned by AdamW can be understood as an exponential\nmoving average (EMA) of recent updates. This gives critical insights for how to\nset the weight decay in AdamW, and how the weight decay should scale with model\nand dataset size. In particular, the key hyperparameter for an exponential\nmoving average is the EMA timescale. Intuitively, the EMA timescale can be\nunderstood as the number of recent iterations the EMA averages over. Given a\nfixed learning rate, there is a one-to-one mapping from the EMA timescale to\nthe usual weight decay hyperparameter. Thus, choosing an EMA timescale\nimplicitly sets the weight decay. Importantly, there are natural guidelines for\nsensible values for the EMA timescale: we need to average over all datapoints,\nso the EMA timescale should not be (much) smaller than 1 epoch, and we need to\nforget early updates, so the EMA timescale should not be (much) bigger than the\ntotal number of training epochs. In our experiments, we find that optimal EMA\ntimescales are consistent with these guidelines, as are the hyperparameters\nchosen in recent large-scale LLM pretraining runs (e.g.\\ Llama 1+2 and Stable\nLM). Critically, these guidelines suggest that the optimal EMA timescale should\nnot change (much) as we scale the model and dataset. That implies that as the\ndataset size increases, the optimal weight decay should fall. Moreover, as the\nmodel size increases, the optimal weight decay should also increase (if we\nfollow the muP recommendation for scaling the learning rate).",

To assess system hallucination robustness, hallucination\nranking approaches have been developed for specific tasks such as image\ncaptioning, question answering, summarization, or biography generation.\nHowever, these approaches typically compare model outputs to gold-standard\nreferences or labels, limiting hallucination benchmarking for new domains. This\nwork proposes \"CrossCheckGPT\", a reference-free universal hallucination ranking\nfor multimodal foundation models. The core idea of CrossCheckGPT is that the\nsame hallucinated content is unlikely to be generated by different independent\nsystems, hence cross-system consistency can provide meaningful and accurate\nhallucination assessment scores. CrossCheckGPT can be applied to any model or\ntask, provided that the information consistency between outputs can be measured\nthrough an appropriate distance metric. Focusing on multimodal large language\nmodels that generate text, we explore two information consistency measures:\nCrossCheck-explicit and CrossCheck-implicit. We showcase the applicability of\nour method for hallucination ranking across various modalities, namely the\ntext, image, and audio-visual domains.

Existing\nsparse-to-dense approaches typically employ shared context-independent queries\nacross various input images, which fails to capture distinctions among them as\nthe focal regions of different inputs vary and may result in undirected feature\naggregation of cross-attention. Additionally, the absence of depth information\nmay lead to points projected onto the image plane sharing the same 2D position\nor similar sampling points in the feature map, resulting in depth ambiguity. In\nthis paper, we present a novel context and geometry aware voxel transformer. It\nutilizes a context aware query generator to initialize context-dependent\nqueries tailored to individual input images, effectively capturing their unique\ncharacteristics and aggregating information within the region of interest.\nFurthermore, it extend deformable cross-attention from 2D to 3D pixel space,\nenabling the differentiation of points with similar image coordinates based on\ntheir depth coordinates.

        "abstract": "Understanding egocentric human-object interaction (HOI) is a fundamental\naspect of human-centric perception, facilitating applications like AR/VR and\nembodied AI. For the egocentric HOI, in addition to perceiving semantics e.g.,\n''what'' interaction is occurring, capturing ''where'' the interaction\nspecifically manifests in 3D space is also crucial, which links the perception\nand operation. Existing methods primarily leverage observations of HOI to\ncapture interaction regions from an exocentric view. However, incomplete\nobservations of interacting parties in the egocentric view introduce ambiguity\nbetween visual observations and interaction contents, impairing their efficacy.\nFrom the egocentric view, humans integrate the visual cortex, cerebellum, and\nbrain to internalize their intentions and interaction concepts of objects,\nallowing for the pre-formulation of interactions and making behaviors even when\ninteraction regions are out of sight. In light of this, we propose harmonizing\nthe visual appearance, head motion, and 3D object to excavate the object\ninteraction concept and subject intention, jointly inferring 3D human contact\nand object affordance from egocentric videos. To achieve this, we present\nEgoChoir, which links object structures with interaction contexts inherent in\nappearance and head motion to reveal object affordance, further utilizing it to\nmodel human contact. Additionally, a gradient modulation is employed to adopt\nappropriate clues for capturing interaction regions across various egocentric\nscenarios. Moreover, 3D contact and affordance are annotated for egocentric\nvideos collected from Ego-Exo4D and GIMO to support the task. Extensive\nexperiments on them demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of EgoChoir.\nCode and data will be open.",

This work introduces a new way to enhance stochastic\napproaches to SHM through the use of deep neural networks. A learnable feature\nextractor and a feature-oriented surrogate model are synergistically exploited\nto evaluate a likelihood function within a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling\nalgorithm. The feature extractor undergoes a supervised pairwise training to\nmap sensor recordings onto a low-dimensional metric space, which encapsulates\nthe sensitivity to structural health parameters. The surrogate model maps the\nstructural health parameters onto their feature description. The procedure\nenables the updating of beliefs about structural health parameters, effectively\nreplacing the need for a computationally expensive numerical (finite element)\nmodel. A preliminary offline phase involves the generation of a labeled dataset\nto train both the feature extractor and the surrogate model. Within a\nsimulation-based SHM framework, training vibration responses are\ncost-effectively generated by means of a multi-fidelity surrogate modeling\nstrategy to approximate sensor recordings under varying damage and operational\nconditions. The multi-fidelity surrogate exploits model order reduction and\nartificial neural networks to speed up the data generation phase while ensuring\nthe damage-sensitivity of the approximated signals.

To overcome the challenges of a\nlarge action space, a self-supervised pre-training method is proposed to warm\nup the policy network before the RL training stage. To alleviate the\ndistributional mismatch issue in general self-supervised RL (SSRL), in our\nsupervised learning (SL) stage, the agent selects actions based on the policy\nnetwork and learns from generated labels; this self-generation of labels is the\nintuition behind the name self-supervised. With this training framework, the\ninformation density of our SL objective is increased and the agent is prevented\nfrom getting stuck with the early rewarded paths. Our self-supervised RL (SSRL)\nmethod improves the performance of RL by pairing it with the wide coverage\nachieved by SL during pretraining, since the breadth of the SL objective makes\nit infeasible to train an agent with that alone.

The pairwise interaction layer\nuses sparse representations from a Winner-take-all style activation function to\nfind the relevant correlations in the hidden layer representations. The\nnetworks using this architecture show competitive performance in MNIST and\nFashionMNIST-based continual image classification experiments. We demonstrate\nthis in an online streaming continual learning setup where the learning system\ncannot access task labels or boundaries.",

        "abstract": "Existing Maximum-Entropy (MaxEnt) Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods for\ncontinuous action spaces are typically formulated based on actor-critic\nframeworks and optimized through alternating steps of policy evaluation and\npolicy improvement. In the policy evaluation steps, the critic is updated to\ncapture the soft Q-function. In the policy improvement steps, the actor is\nadjusted in accordance with the updated soft Q-function. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new MaxEnt RL framework modeled using Energy-Based Normalizing\nFlows (EBFlow). This framework integrates the policy evaluation steps and the\npolicy improvement steps, resulting in a single objective training process. Our\nmethod enables the calculation of the soft value function used in the policy\nevaluation target without Monte Carlo approximation. Moreover, this design\nsupports the modeling of multi-modal action distributions while facilitating\nefficient action sampling. To evaluate the performance of our method, we\nconducted experiments on the MuJoCo benchmark suite and a number of\nhigh-dimensional robotic tasks simulated by Omniverse Isaac Gym. The evaluation\nresults demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to\nwidely-adopted representative baselines.",

Since\nin some SDP instances all feasible solutions have irrational entries, numerical\nsolvers that work with rational numbers can only find an approximate solution.\nWe study the following question: is it possible to certify feasibility of a\ngiven SDP using an approximate solution that is sufficiently close to some\nexact solution? Existing approaches make the assumption that there exist\nrational feasible solutions (and use techniques such as rounding and lattice\nreduction algorithms).\n  We propose an alternative approach that does not need this assumption. More\nspecifically, we show how to construct a system of polynomial equations whose\nset of real solutions is guaranteed to have an isolated correct solution\n(assuming that the target exact solution is maximum-rank). This allows, in\nparticular, to use algorithms from real algebraic geometry for solving systems\nof polynomial equations, yielding a hybrid (or symbolic-numerical) method for\nSDPs. We experimentally compare it with a pure symbolic method in [Henrion,\nNaldi, Safey El Din; SIAM J.

        "abstract": "Graphlets of order $k$ in a graph $G$ are connected subgraphs induced by $k$\nnodes (called $k$-graphlets) or by $k$ edges (called edge $k$-graphlets). They\nare among the interesting subgraphs in network analysis to get insights on both\nthe local and global structure of a network. While several algorithms exist for\ndiscovering and enumerating graphlets, the cost per solution of such algorithms\ntypically depends on the size of the graph $G$, or its maximum degree. In real\nnetworks, even the latter can be in the order of millions, whereas $k$ is\ntypically required to be a small value. In this paper we provide the first\nalgorithm to list all graphlets of order $k$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$ with an\namortized cost per solution depending \\emph{solely} on the order $k$,\ncontrarily to previous approaches where the cost depends \\emph{also} on the\nsize of $G$ or its maximum degree. Specifically, we show that it is possible to\nlist $k$-graphlets in $O(k^2)$ time per solution, and to list edge\n$k$-graphlets in $O(k)$ time per solution. Furthermore we show that, if the\ninput graph has bounded degree, then the cost per solution for listing\n$k$-graphlets is reduced to $O(k)$. Whenever $k = O(1)$, as it is often the\ncase in practical settings, these algorithms are the first to achieve constant\ntime per solution.",

We\nthen identify a set of sufficient conditions ensuring the existence of pathwise\ngradients of solution trajectories and event times with respect to the\nnetwork's parameters and show how these gradients satisfy a recursive relation.\nFurthermore, we introduce a general-purpose loss function defined by means of a\nnew class of signature kernels indexed on c\\`adl\\`ag rough paths and use it to\ntrain SSNNs as generative models. We provide an end-to-end autodifferentiable\nsolver for Event SDEs and make its implementation available as part of the\n$\\texttt{diffrax}$ library.

To reduce the computational cost of alignment training of LLMs,\nespecially for those with a huge number of parameters, and to reutilize learned\nvalue alignment, we propose ConTrans, a novel framework that enables\nweak-to-strong alignment transfer via concept transplantation. From the\nperspective of representation engineering, ConTrans refines concept vectors in\nvalue alignment from a source LLM (usually a weak yet aligned LLM). The refined\nconcept vectors are then reformulated to adapt to the target LLM (usually a\nstrong yet unaligned base LLM) via affine transformation. In the third step,\nConTrans transplants the reformulated concept vectors into the residual stream\nof the target LLM. Experiments demonstrate the successful transplantation of a\nwide range of aligned concepts from 7B models to 13B and 70B models across\nmultiple LLMs and LLM families. Remarkably, ConTrans even surpasses\ninstruction-tuned models in terms of truthfulness. Experiment results validate\nthe effectiveness of both inter-LLM-family and intra-LLM-family concept\ntransplantation.

        "abstract": "Recent studies have attempted to refine the Transformer architecture to\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF)\ntasks. Despite surpassing many linear forecasting models with ever-improving\nperformance, we remain skeptical of Transformers as a solution for LTSF. We\nattribute the effectiveness of these models largely to the adopted Patch\nmechanism, which enhances sequence locality to an extent yet fails to fully\naddress the loss of temporal information inherent to the permutation-invariant\nself-attention mechanism. Further investigation suggests that simple linear\nlayers augmented with the Patch mechanism may outperform complex\nTransformer-based LTSF models. Moreover, diverging from models that use channel\nindependence, our research underscores the importance of cross-variable\ninteractions in enhancing the performance of multivariate time series\nforecasting. The interaction information between variables is highly valuable\nbut has been misapplied in past studies, leading to suboptimal cross-variable\nmodels. Based on these insights, we propose a novel and simple Patch-based\nDecomposed MLP (PDMLP) for LTSF tasks. Specifically, we employ simple moving\naverages to extract smooth components and noise-containing residuals from time\nseries data, engaging in semantic information interchange through channel\nmixing and specializing in random noise with channel independence processing.\nThe PDMLP model consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on several\nreal-world datasets.

However, achieving multi-modal IAD in practical production lines\nremains a work in progress that requires consideration of the trade-offs\nbetween costs and benefits associated with introducing new modalities, while\nensuring compatibility with current processes. Combining fast in-line\ninspections with high-resolution, time-consuming, near-line characterization\ntechniques to enhance detection accuracy fits well into the existing quality\ncontrol process, but only part of the samples can be tested with expensive\nnear-line methods.

The delay causes organisations, which depend on NVD for vulnerability\nmanagement and security measurement, to be more vulnerable to zero-day attacks.\nThus, it is essential to come out with a technique and tool to extract the CPEs\nin the CVE summaries accurately and quickly. In this work, we propose the\nCPE-Identifier system, an automated CPE annotating and extracting system, from\nthe CVE summaries. The system can be used as a tool to identify CPE entities\nfrom new CVE text inputs. Moreover, we also automate the data generating and\nlabeling processes using deep learning models. Due to the complexity of the CVE\ntexts, new technical terminologies appear frequently. To identify novel words\nin future CVE texts, we apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) Named Entity\nRecognition (NER), to identify new technical jargons in the text. Our proposed\nmodel achieves an F1 score of 95.48%, an accuracy score of 99.13%, a precision\nof 94.83%, and a recall of 96.14%. We show that it outperforms prior works on\nautomated CVE-CPE labeling by more than 9% on all metrics.",

        "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enable users to articulate their\npreferences and provide feedback through natural language. With the advent of\nlarge language models (LLMs), the potential to enhance user engagement with CRS\nand augment the recommendation process with LLM-generated content has received\nincreasing attention. However, the efficacy of LLM-powered CRS is contingent\nupon the use of prompts, and the subjective perception of recommendation\nquality can differ across various recommendation domains. Therefore, we have\ndeveloped a ChatGPT-based CRS to investigate the impact of these two factors,\nprompt guidance (PG) and recommendation domain (RD), on the overall user\nexperience of the system. We conducted an online empirical study (N = 100) by\nemploying a mixed-method approach that utilized a between-subjects design for\nthe variable of PG (with vs. without) and a within-subjects design for RD (book\nrecommendations vs. job recommendations). The findings reveal that PG can\nsubstantially enhance the system's explainability, adaptability, perceived ease\nof use, and transparency. Moreover, users are inclined to perceive a greater\nsense of novelty and demonstrate a higher propensity to engage with and try\nrecommended items in the context of book recommendations as opposed to job\nrecommendations. Furthermore, the influence of PG on certain user experience\nmetrics and interactive behaviors appears to be modulated by the recommendation\ndomain, as evidenced by the interaction effects between the two examined\nfactors.

Most existing\nliterature assumes a paradigm where 'expert' organized disinformation creators\nand flawed AI models deceive 'ordinary' users. Based on longitudinal\nethnographic research with misinformation creators and consumers between\n2022-2023, we instead find that GenAI supports bricolage work, where\nnon-experts increasingly use GenAI to remix, repackage, and (re)produce content\nto meet their personal needs and desires. This research yielded four key\nfindings: First, participants primarily used GenAI for creation, rather than\ntruth-seeking. Second, a spreading 'influencer millionaire' narrative drove\nparticipants to become content creators, using GenAI as a productivity tool to\ngenerate a volume of (often misinformative) content. Third, GenAI lowered the\nbarrier to entry for content creation across modalities, enticing consumers to\nbecome creators and significantly increasing existing creators' output.\nFinally, participants used Gen AI to learn and deploy marketing tactics to\nexpand engagement and monetize their content. We argue for shifting analysis\nfrom the public as consumers of AI content to bricoleurs who use GenAI\ncreatively, often without a detailed understanding of its underlying\ntechnology.

In this paper, we investigate the waveform design problem\nin a downlink multi-user and multi-target ISAC system under different C&S\nperformance preferences. The multi-user interference (MUI) may critically\ndegrade the communication performance. To eliminate the MUI, we employ the\nconstructive interference mechanism into the ISAC system, which saves the power\nbudget for communication. However, due to the conflict between C&S metrics, it\nis intractable for the ISAC system to achieve the optimal performance of C&S\nobjective simultaneously.

Existing log parsers, while\nhighly effective on standardized public datasets, struggle to maintain\nperformance and efficiency when confronted with the sheer scale and diversity\nof real-world industrial logs. These challenges are two-fold: 1) massive log\ntemplates: The performance and efficiency of most existing parsers will be\nsignificantly reduced when logs of growing quantities and different lengths; 2)\nComplex and changeable semantics: Traditional template-matching algorithms\ncannot accurately match the log templates of complicated industrial logs\nbecause they cannot utilize cross-language logs with similar semantics. To\naddress these issues, we propose ECLIPSE, Enhanced Cross-Lingual Industrial log\nParsing with Semantic Entropy-LCS, since cross-language logs can robustly parse\nindustrial logs. On the one hand, it integrates two efficient data-driven\ntemplate-matching algorithms and Faiss indexing. On the other hand, driven by\nthe powerful semantic understanding ability of the Large Language Model (LLM),\nthe semantics of log keywords were accurately extracted, and the retrieval\nspace was effectively reduced. Notably, we launch a Chinese and English\ncross-platform industrial log parsing benchmark ECLIPSE- BENCH to evaluate the\nperformance of mainstream parsers in industrial scenarios. Our experimental\nresults across public benchmarks and ECLIPSE- BENCH underscore the superior\nperformance and robustness of our proposed ECLIPSE.

        "abstract": "A unique approach for the mid-air autonomous aerial interception of\nnon-cooperating UAV by a flying robot equipped with a net is presented in this\npaper. A novel interception guidance method dubbed EPN is proposed, designed to\ncatch agile maneuvering targets while relying on onboard state estimation and\ntracking. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art approaches in\nsimulations using 100 different trajectories of the target with varying\ncomplexity comprising almost 14 hours of flight data, and EPN demonstrates the\nshortest response time and the highest number of interceptions, which are key\nparameters of agile interception. To enable robust transfer from theory and\nsimulation to a real-world implementation, we aim to avoid overfitting to\nspecific assumptions about the target, and to tackle interception of a target\nfollowing an unknown general trajectory. Furthermore, we identify several often\noverlooked problems related to tracking and estimation of the target's state\nthat can have a significant influence on the overall performance of the system.\nWe propose the use of a novel state estimation filter based on the IMM filter\nand a new measurement model. Simulated experiments show that the proposed\nsolution provides significant improvements in estimation accuracy over the\ncommonly employed KF approaches when considering general trajectories. Based on\nthese results, we employ the proposed filtering and guidance methods to\nimplement a complete autonomous interception system, which is thoroughly\nevaluated in realistic simulations and tested in real-world experiments with a\nmaneuvering target going far beyond the performance of any state-of-the-art\nsolution.",

        "abstract": "Preference optimization is a standard approach to fine-tuning large language\nmodels to align with human preferences. The quality, diversity, and quantity of\nthe preference dataset are critical to the effectiveness of preference\noptimization. However, obtaining a large amount of high-quality and diverse\npreference annotations is difficult in many applications. This raises the\nquestion of how to use the limited annotation budget to create an effective\npreference dataset. To this end, we propose Annotation-Efficient Preference\nOptimization (AEPO). Instead of exhaustively annotating preference over all\navailable response texts, AEPO selects a subset of responses that maximizes\nquality and diversity from the available responses, and then annotates\npreference over the selected ones. In this way, AEPO focuses the annotation\nbudget on labeling preference over a smaller subset of responses with diversity\nand of high quality. We evaluate the performance of Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) using AEPO and show that it outperforms models trained using\na standard DPO with the same annotation budget.

In this study, we introduce a unified\ntheoretical framework to attribute Bayesian inconsistency to model\nmisspecification and inadequate priors.

Additionally, we highlight a distinctive feature of Laplace\napproximation, which ensures that the generalized normalizing constant can be\ntreated as invariant, unlike the typical scenario in general Bayesian learning\nwhere this constant varies with model parameters post-generalization. Building\non this insight, we propose the generalized Laplace approximation, which\ninvolves a simple adjustment to the computation of the Hessian matrix of the\nregularized loss function.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13517v1",
        "abstract": "With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in daily life,\nconcerns have emerged regarding their potential misuse and societal impact.\nWatermarking is proposed to trace the usage of specific models by injecting\npatterns into their generated texts. An ideal watermark should produce outputs\nthat are nearly indistinguishable from those of the original LLM\n(imperceptibility), while ensuring a high detection rate (efficacy), even when\nthe text is partially altered (robustness). Despite many methods having been\nproposed, none have simultaneously achieved all three properties, revealing an\ninherent trade-off. This paper utilizes a key-centered scheme to unify existing\nwatermarking techniques by decomposing a watermark into two distinct modules: a\nkey module and a mark module. Through this decomposition, we demonstrate for\nthe first time that the key module significantly contributes to the trade-off\nissues observed in prior methods. Specifically, this reflects the conflict\nbetween the scale of the key sampling space during generation and the\ncomplexity of key restoration during detection. To this end, we introduce\n\\textbf{WaterPool}, a simple yet effective key module that preserves a complete\nkey sampling space required by imperceptibility while utilizing semantics-based\nsearch to improve the key restoration process. WaterPool can integrate with\nmost watermarks, acting as a plug-in. Our experiments with three well-known\nwatermarking techniques show that WaterPool significantly enhances their\nperformance, achieving near-optimal imperceptibility and markedly improving\nefficacy and robustness (+12.73\\% for KGW, +20.27\\% for EXP, +7.27\\% for ITS).",

        "abstract": "Recently, tremendous strides have been made to align the generation of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) with human values to mitigate toxic or unhelpful\ncontent. Leveraging Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) proves\neffective and is widely adopted by researchers. However, implementing RLHF is\ncomplex, and its sensitivity to hyperparameters renders achieving stable\nperformance and scalability challenging. Furthermore, prevailing approaches to\npreference alignment primarily concentrate on pairwise comparisons, with\nlimited exploration into multi-response scenarios, thereby overlooking the\npotential richness within the candidate pool. For the above reasons, we propose\na new approach: Listwise Reward Enhancement for Preference Alignment (LIRE), a\ngradient-based reward optimization approach that incorporates the offline\nrewards of multiple responses into a streamlined listwise framework, thus\neliminating the need for online sampling during training. LIRE is\nstraightforward to implement, requiring minimal parameter tuning, and\nseamlessly aligns with the pairwise paradigm while naturally extending to\nmulti-response scenarios. Moreover, we introduce a self-enhancement algorithm\naimed at iteratively refining the reward during training. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that LIRE consistently outperforms existing methods across several\nbenchmarks on dialogue and summarization tasks, with good transferability to\nout-of-distribution data, assessed using proxy reward models and human\nannotators.",

This prevents the human users to\ninterrupt the robot, which limits speech-based human-robot interaction. To\nenable a more natural interaction which allows for such interruptions, we\npropose an audio processing pipeline for filtering out robot's ego speech using\nonly a single-channel microphone. This pipeline takes advantage of the\npossibility to feed the robot ego speech signal, generated by a text-to-speech\nAPI, as training data into a machine learning model. The proposed pipeline\ncombines a convolutional neural network and spectral subtraction to extract\noverlapping human speech from the audio recorded by the robot-embedded\nmicrophone. When evaluating on a held-out test set, we find that this pipeline\noutperforms our previous approach to this task, as well as state-of-the-art\ntarget speech extraction systems that were retrained on the same dataset. We\nhave also integrated the proposed pipeline into a lightweight robot software\ndevelopment framework to make it available for broader use. As a step towards\ndemonstrating the feasibility of deploying our pipeline, we use this framework\nto evaluate the effectiveness of the pipeline in a small lab-based feasibility\npilot using the social robot Pepper. Our results show that when participants\ninterrupt the robot, the pipeline can extract the participant's speech from\none-second streaming audio buffers received by the robot-embedded\nsingle-channel microphone, hence in near-real time.",

The approach has been implemented, fine-tuned and\nevaluated on stable diffusion and has led to a performance that has been\nevaluated to be at least 60\\% better than existing commercial and research\nText-to-image models. Additionally, the built self-rewarding mechanism allowed\na fully automated generation of images, while increasing the visual quality of\nthe generated images and also more efficient following of prompt instructions.\nThe code used in this work is freely available on\nhttps://github.com/safouaneelg/SRT2I.",

        "abstract": "The advent of high-contrast imaging instruments combined with\nmedium-resolution spectrographs allows spectral and temporal dimensions to be\ncombined with spatial dimensions to detect and potentially characterize\nexoplanets with higher sensitivity. We develop a new method to effectively\nleverage the spectral and spatial dimensions in integral-field spectroscopy\n(IFS) datasets using a supervised deep-learning algorithm to improve the\ndetection sensitivity to high-contrast exoplanets. We begin by applying a data\ntransform whereby the IFS datasets are replaced by cross-correlation\ncoefficient tensors obtained by cross-correlating our data with young gas giant\nspectral template spectra. This transformed data is then used to train machine\nlearning (ML) algorithms. We train a 2D CNN and 3D LSTM with our data. We\ncompare the ML models with a non-ML algorithm, based on the STIM map of\narXiv:1810.06895. We test our algorithms on simulated young gas giants in a\ndataset that contains no known exoplanet, and explore the sensitivity of\nalgorithms to detect these exoplanets at contrasts ranging from 1e-3 to 1e-4 at\ndifferent radial separations. We quantify the sensitivity using modified\nreceiver operating characteristic curves (mROC). We discover that the ML\nalgorithms produce fewer false positives and have a higher true positive rate\nthan the STIM-based algorithm, and the true positive rate of ML algorithms is\nless impacted by changing radial separation. We discover that the velocity\ndimension is an important differentiating factor. Through this paper, we\ndemonstrate that ML techniques have the potential to improve the detection\nlimits and reduce false positives for directly imaged planets in IFS datasets,\nafter transforming the spectral dimension into a radial velocity dimension\nthrough a cross-correlation operation.",

Previous research shows that smartphones can negatively\nimpact face-to-face social interactions. Many HCI studies have addressed this\nby limiting smartphone use during social interactions. While these studies show\na decrease in smartphone use, restrictive approaches have their drawbacks.\nUsers need high levels of self-regulation to follow them, and they may cause\nunintended effects like withdrawal symptoms. Given the impact of smartphones on\nsocial interactions, both positive and negative, new solutions are needed to\nreduce the negative effects of excessive smartphone use without resorting to\nrestrictive methods. This thesis aims to explore smartphone use behavior in the\ncontext of social interactions and relationships using various data collection\ntechniques to understand how this behavior hinders and supports social\ninteractions. We began with in situ observations and focus group sessions.\nBased on insights from these steps, we developed two research prototypes to\nimprove social interactions without restricting smartphone use. We gathered\nuser feedback, reactions, and concerns about these prototypes through user\nstudies. Finally, we evaluated how these prototypes affected conversation\nquality in social interactions through an experimental user study.

        "abstract": "Real-world data often exhibit extreme imbalances and out-of-distribution\n(OOD) instances, which significantly biases the model training. While it has\nbeen extensively studied in vision and language domains separately, the impact\nof long-tailed open worlds on multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has\nbeen largely overlooked. In this paper, we first demonstrate the susceptibility\nand vulnerability of vision-language models to significant biases caused by\ntail drift and out-of-distribution (OOD) drift during both the pre-training and\nfine-tuning stages. To eliminate the bias from different sources, we integrate\nthe tailed drift adaptation and OOD drift detection into a unified framework by\nextending the concept drift theory to multi-modal. Specifically, a\nT-distribution-based drift adapter is proposed to effectively mitigate the bias\ninduced by the long-tailed problem, which also facilitates the model in\ndistinguishing OOD data through explicit distribution modelling. Extensive\nexperiments show significant improvements in our model's ability to adapt to\ntailed drift and OOD drift. Moreover, it enhances the efficiency and accuracy\nof image-text alignment in vision language model pre-training, particularly in\nthe long-tail open world scenario. Furthermore, we create a set of multi-modal\ndatasets called OpenMMlo, specifically tailored for the long-tailed open world\nscenario, to validate our findings.

The most effective approach is the two-stage scheme, which\nfinds a small interval first and then gets a refined estimate by clipping\nsamples into the interval. However, the clipping operation induces bias, which\nis serious if the sample distribution is heavy-tailed. Besides, users with\nlarge local sample sizes can make the sensitivity much larger, thus the method\nis not suitable for imbalanced users. Motivated by these challenges, we propose\na Huber loss minimization approach to mean estimation under user-level\ndifferential privacy. The connecting points of Huber loss can be adaptively\nadjusted to deal with imbalanced users. Moreover, it avoids the clipping\noperation, thus significantly reducing the bias compared with the two-stage\napproach. We provide a theoretical analysis of our approach, which gives the\nnoise strength needed for privacy protection, as well as the bound of mean\nsquared error.

        "abstract": "The development of supervised deep learning-based methods for multi-label\nscene classification (MLC) is one of the prominent research directions in\nremote sensing (RS). Yet, collecting annotations for large RS image archives is\ntime-consuming and costly. To address this issue, several data augmentation\nmethods have been introduced in RS. Among others, the data augmentation\ntechnique CutMix, which combines parts of two existing training images to\ngenerate an augmented image, stands out as a particularly effective approach.\nHowever, the direct application of CutMix in RS MLC can lead to the erasure or\naddition of class labels (i.e., label noise) in the augmented (i.e., combined)\ntraining image. To address this problem, we introduce a label propagation (LP)\nstrategy that allows the effective application of CutMix in the context of MLC\nproblems in RS without being affected by label noise. To this end, our proposed\nLP strategy exploits pixel-level class positional information to update the\nmulti-label of the augmented training image. We propose to access such class\npositional information from reference maps associated to each training image\n(e.g., thematic products) or from class explanation masks provided by an\nexplanation method if no reference maps are available. Similarly to pairing two\ntraining images, our LP strategy carries out a pairing operation on the\nassociated pixel-level class positional information to derive the updated\nmulti-label for the augmented image. Experimental results show the\neffectiveness of our LP strategy in general and its robustness in the case of\nvarious simulated and real scenarios with noisy class positional information in\nparticular.",

While\nseveral studies have explored autonomous approaches to distilling and\nannotating instructions from more powerful proprietary LLMs, such as ChatGPT,\nthey often neglect the impact of task distributions and the varying difficulty\nof instructions of the training sets. This oversight can lead to imbalanced\nknowledge capabilities and poor generalization powers of small student LLMs. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce Task-Aware Curriculum Planning for\nInstruction Refinement (TAPIR), a multi-round distillation framework with\nbalanced task distributions and dynamic difficulty adjustment. This approach\nutilizes an oracle LLM to select instructions that are difficult for a student\nLLM to follow and distill instructions with balanced task distributions. By\nincorporating curriculum planning, our approach systematically escalates the\ndifficulty levels, progressively enhancing the student LLM's capabilities. We\nrigorously evaluate TAPIR using two widely recognized benchmarks, including\nAlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench. The empirical results demonstrate that the student\nLLMs, trained with our method and less training data, outperform larger\ninstruction-tuned models and strong distillation baselines. The improvement is\nparticularly notable in complex tasks, such as logical reasoning and code\ngeneration.",

It employs a two-stage training\nprocess, with local embedding and prediction models on client agents and a\nglobal transformer decoder model on the server. Our comprehensive evaluation\nusing the benchmark D4RL dataset highlights the superior performance of our\nalgorithm in federated split learning for personalized agents, coupled with\nsignificant reductions in communication and computational overhead compared to\ntraditional centralized training approaches. The FSDT framework demonstrates\nstrong potential for enabling efficient and privacy-preserving collaborative\nlearning in applications such as autonomous driving decision systems.

        "abstract": "We present a novel high order semi-implicit hybrid finite volume/virtual\nelement numerical scheme for the solution of compressible flows on Voronoi\ntessellations. The method relies on the flux splitting of the compressible\nNavier-Stokes equations into three sub-systems: a convective sub-system solved\nexplicitly using a finite volume (FV) scheme, and the viscous and pressure\nsub-systems which are discretized implicitly at the aid of a virtual element\nmethod (VEM). Consequently, the time step restriction of the overall algorithm\ndepends only on the mean flow velocity and not on the fast pressure waves nor\non the viscous eigenvalues. As such, the proposed methodology is well suited\nfor the solution of low Mach number flows at all Reynolds numbers. Moreover,\nthe scheme is proven to be globally energy conserving so that shock capturing\nproperties are retrieved in high Mach number flows. To reach high order of\naccuracy in time and space, an IMEX Runge-Kutta time stepping strategy is\nemployed together with high order spatial reconstructions in terms of CWENO\npolynomials and virtual element space basis functions. The chosen\ndiscretization techniques allow the use of general polygonal grids, a useful\ntool when dealing with complex domain configurations.

The next-generation of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications\n(xURLLC) scenario within 6G networks requires a frame error rate (FER) below\n10-9. However, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, the standard in 5G new\nradio (NR), encounter a challenge known as the error floor phenomenon, which\nhinders to achieve such low rates. To tackle this problem, we introduce an\ninnovative solution: boosted neural min-sum (NMS) decoder. This decoder\noperates identically to conventional NMS decoders, but is trained by novel\ntraining methods including: i) boosting learning with uncorrected vectors, ii)\nblock-wise training schedule to address the vanishing gradient issue, iii)\ndynamic weight sharing to minimize the number of trainable weights, iv)\ntransfer learning to reduce the required sample count, and v) data augmentation\nto expedite the sampling process. Leveraging these training strategies, the\nboosted NMS decoder achieves the state-of-the art performance in reducing the\nerror floor as well as superior waterfall performance. Remarkably, we fulfill\nthe 6G xURLLC requirement for 5G LDPC codes without the severe error floor.\nAdditionally, the boosted NMS decoder, once its weights are trained, can\nperform decoding without additional modules, making it highly practical for\nimmediate application.",

        "abstract": "Transformers have revolutionized various domains of artificial intelligence\ndue to their unique ability to model long-range dependencies in data. However,\nthey lack in nuanced, context-dependent modulation of features and information\nflow. This paper introduces two significant enhancements to the transformer\narchitecture - the Evaluator Adjuster Unit (EAU) and Gated Residual Connections\n(GRC) - designed to address these limitations. The EAU dynamically modulates\nattention outputs based on the relevance of the input context, allowing for\nmore adaptive response patterns. Concurrently, the GRC modifies the\ntransformer's residual connections through a gating mechanism that selectively\ncontrols the information flow, thereby enhancing the network's ability to focus\non contextually important features. We evaluate the performance of these\nenhancements across several benchmarks in natural language processing. Our\nresults demonstrate improved adaptability and efficiency, suggesting that these\nmodifications could set new standards for designing flexible and context-aware\ntransformer models.",

Attacking LLMs is\ninherently risky in security review, while prohibitively expensive. Besides,\nthe continuous iteration of LLMs will degrade the robustness of backdoors. In\nthis paper, we propose TrojanRAG, which employs a joint backdoor attack in the\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation, thereby manipulating LLMs in universal attack\nscenarios. Specifically, the adversary constructs elaborate target contexts and\ntrigger sets. Multiple pairs of backdoor shortcuts are orthogonally optimized\nby contrastive learning, thus constraining the triggering conditions to a\nparameter subspace to improve the matching. To improve the recall of the RAG\nfor the target contexts, we introduce a knowledge graph to construct structured\ndata to achieve hard matching at a fine-grained level. Moreover, we normalize\nthe backdoor scenarios in LLMs to analyze the real harm caused by backdoors\nfrom both attackers' and users' perspectives and further verify whether the\ncontext is a favorable tool for jailbreaking models.

        "abstract": "Continuous space-time video super-resolution (C-STVSR) aims to simultaneously\nenhance video resolution and frame rate at an arbitrary scale. Recently,\nimplicit neural representation (INR) has been applied to video restoration,\nrepresenting videos as implicit fields that can be decoded at an arbitrary\nscale. However, the highly ill-posed nature of C-STVSR limits the effectiveness\nof current INR-based methods: they assume linear motion between frames and use\ninterpolation or feature warping to generate features at arbitrary\nspatiotemporal positions with two consecutive frames. This restrains C-STVSR\nfrom capturing rapid and nonlinear motion and long-term dependencies (involving\nmore than two frames) in complex dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel C-STVSR framework, called HR-INR, which captures both holistic\ndependencies and regional motions based on INR. It is assisted by an event\ncamera, a novel sensor renowned for its high temporal resolution and low\nlatency. To fully utilize the rich temporal information from events, we design\na feature extraction consisting of (1) a regional event feature extractor -\ntaking events as inputs via the proposed event temporal pyramid representation\nto capture the regional nonlinear motion and (2) a holistic event-frame feature\nextractor for long-term dependence and continuity motion.

Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these QEIS methods\ndiminishes significantly when confronted with limited training data.

To address this problem, we propose a novel\nmethod for unsupervised pre-training in low-data regimes.

(3) Kernel Supervision: Formulates supervision for pre-training at the\nkernel level to ensure robust learning.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an elastic-gap free strain gradient crystal plasticity\nmodel that addresses dissipation caused by plastic slip gradient and grain\nboundary (GB) Burger tensor. The model involves splitting plastic slip gradient\nand GB Burger tensor into energetic dissipative quantities. Unlike conventional\nmodels, the bulk and GB defect energy are considered to be a quadratic\nfunctional of the energetic portion of slip gradient and GB Burgers tensor. The\nhigher-order stresses for each individual slip systems and GB stresses are\nderived from the defect energy, following a similar evolution as the\nArmstrong-Frederick type backstress model in classical plasticity. The\nevolution equations consist of a hardening and a relaxation term. The\nrelaxation term brings the nonlinearity in hardening and causes an additional\ndissipation. The applicability of the proposed model is numerically established\nwith the help of two-dimensional finite element implementation. Specifically,\nthe bulk and GB relaxation coefficients are critically evaluated based on\nvarious circumstances, considering single crystal infinite shear layer,\nperiodic bicrystal shearing, and bicrystal tension problem. In contrast to the\nGurtin-type model, the proposed model smoothly captures the apparent\nstrengthening at saturation without causing any abrupt stress jump under\nnon-proportional loading conditions. Moreover, when subjected to cyclic\nloading, the stress-strain curve maintains its curvature during reverse\nloading. The numerical simulation reveals that the movement of geometrically\nnecessary dislocation (GND) towards the GB is influenced by the bulk recovery\ncoefficient, while the dissipation and amount of accumulation of GND near the\nGB are controlled by the GB recovery coefficient.",

Nowadays, methods based on parameter-efficient tuning (PET) have\ndemonstrated impressive performance in continual learning. However, these\nmethods are still confronted with a common problem: fine-tuning on consecutive\ndistinct tasks can disrupt the existing parameter distribution and lead to\nforgetting. Recent progress mainly focused in empirically designing efficient\ntuning engineering, lacking investigation of forgetting generation mechanism,\nanti-forgetting criteria and providing theoretical support. Additionally, the\nunresolved trade-off between learning new content and protecting old knowledge\nfurther complicates these challenges. The gradient projection methodology\nrestricts gradient updates to the orthogonal direction of the old feature\nspace, preventing distribution of the parameters from being damaged during\nupdating and significantly suppressing forgetting.

Furthermore, we propose a specially designed video\nLLM model for VTG tasks, VTG-LLM, which (1) effectively integrates timestamp\nknowledge into visual tokens; (2) incorporates absolute-time tokens that\nspecifically handle timestamp knowledge, thereby avoiding concept shifts; and\n(3) introduces a lightweight, high-performance slot-based token compression\nmethod to facilitate the sampling of more video frames. Comprehensive\nexperiments showcase the superior performance of VTG-LLM in comparison to other\nvideo LLM methods across various VTG tasks.

Nonetheless, this progress is shadowed by potential\nprivacy concessions, especially as these platforms frequently merge with\nexisting Web2.0 social media accounts, amplifying data privacy risks for users.\n  In this study, we investigate the nuanced dynamics between user engagement on\nWeb3 social platforms and the consequent privacy concerns. We scrutinize the\nwidespread phenomenon of fabricated activities, which encompasses the\nestablishment of bogus accounts aimed at mimicking popularity and the\ndeliberate distortion of social interactions by some individuals to gain\nfinancial rewards. Such deceptive maneuvers not only distort the true measure\nof the active user base but also amplify privacy threats for all members of the\nuser community. We also find that, notwithstanding their attempts to limit\nsocial exposure, users remain entangled in privacy vulnerabilities. The actions\nof those highly engaged users, albeit often a minority group, can inadvertently\nbreach the privacy of the larger collective.\n  By casting light on the delicate interplay between user engagement, financial\nmotives, and privacy issues, we offer a comprehensive examination of the\nintrinsic challenges and hazards present in the Web3 social milieu. We\nhighlight the urgent need for more stringent privacy measures and ethical\nprotocols to navigate the complex web of social exchanges and financial\nambitions in the rapidly evolving Web3.",

        "abstract": "This study introduces markerless retro-identification of animals, a novel\nconcept and practical technique to identify past occurrences of organisms in\narchived data, that complements traditional forward-looking chronological\nre-identification methods in longitudinal behavioural research. Identification\nof a key individual among multiple subjects may occur late in an experiment if\nit reveals itself through interesting behaviour after a period of\nundifferentiated performance. Often, longitudinal studies also encounter\nsubject attrition during experiments. Effort invested in training software\nmodels to recognise and track such individuals is wasted if they fail to\ncomplete the experiment. Ideally, we would be able to select individuals who\nboth complete an experiment and/or differentiate themselves via interesting\nbehaviour, prior to investing computational resources in training image\nclassification software to recognise them. We propose retro-identification for\nmodel training to achieve this aim. This reduces manual annotation effort and\ncomputational resources by identifying subjects only after they differentiate\nthemselves late, or at an experiment's conclusion. Our study dataset comprises\nobservations made of morphologically similar reed bees (\\textit{Exoneura\nrobusta}) over five days. We evaluated model performance by training on final\nday five data, testing on the sequence of preceding days, and comparing results\nto the usual chronological evaluation from day one. Results indicate no\nsignificant accuracy difference between models. This underscores\nretro-identification's value in improving resource efficiency in longitudinal\nanimal studies.",

This\ncoupling in a cyclic data flow results in a decrease in the utilization of\nunlabeled data information and the confirmation bias on low-quality or\nerroneous pseudo-labels. To address these issues, we propose the Collaboration\nof Teachers Framework (CTF), which consists of multiple pairs of teacher and\nstudent models for training. In the learning process of CTF, the Data\nPerformance Consistency Optimization module (DPCO) informs the best pair of\nteacher models possessing the optimal pseudo-labels during the past training\nprocess, and these most reliable pseudo-labels generated by the best performing\nteacher would guide the other student models.

        "abstract": "Latent generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) have become more and more\npopular, but concerns have arisen regarding potential misuse related to images\ngenerated by these models. It is, therefore, necessary to analyze the origin of\nimages by inferring if a particular image was generated by a specific latent\ngenerative model. Most existing methods (e.g., image watermark and model\nfingerprinting) require extra steps during training or generation. These\nrequirements restrict their usage on the generated images without such extra\noperations, and the extra required operations might compromise the quality of\nthe generated images. In this work, we ask whether it is possible to\neffectively and efficiently trace the images generated by a specific latent\ngenerative model without the aforementioned requirements. To study this\nproblem, we design a latent inversion based method called LatentTracer to trace\nthe generated images of the inspected model by checking if the examined images\ncan be well-reconstructed with an inverted latent input. We leverage gradient\nbased latent inversion and identify a encoder-based initialization critical to\nthe success of our approach. Our experiments on the state-of-the-art latent\ngenerative models, such as Stable Diffusion, show that our method can\ndistinguish the images generated by the inspected model and other images with a\nhigh accuracy and efficiency. Our findings suggest the intriguing possibility\nthat today's latent generative generated images are naturally watermarked by\nthe decoder used in the source models.

The current state-of-the-art\napproaches for Post-training Quantization (PTQ) often require calibration to\nachieve the desired accuracy. This paper presents AdpQ, a novel zero-shot\nadaptive PTQ method for LLMs that achieves the state-of-the-art performance in\nlow-precision quantization (e.g. 3-bit) without requiring any calibration data.\nInspired by Adaptive LASSO regression model, our proposed approach tackles the\nchallenge of outlier activations by separating salient weights using an\nadaptive soft-thresholding method. Guided by Adaptive LASSO, this method\nensures that the quantized weights distribution closely follows the originally\ntrained weights and eliminates the need for calibration data entirely, setting\nour method apart from popular approaches such as SpQR and AWQ. Furthermore, our\nmethod offers an additional benefit in terms of privacy preservation by\neliminating any calibration or training data.

We demonstrate that\nit leverages the Adaptive LASSO to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence\nbetween the quantized weights and the originally trained weights.

This paper proposes a \"Turing test for an AI scientist\" to assess\nwhether an AI agent can conduct scientific research independently, without\nrelying on human-generated knowledge. Drawing inspiration from the historical\ndevelopment of science, we propose seven benchmark tests that evaluate an AI\nagent's ability to make groundbreaking discoveries in various scientific\ndomains. These tests include inferring the heliocentric model from celestial\nobservations, discovering the laws of motion in a simulated environment,\nderiving the differential equation governing vibrating strings, inferring\nMaxwell's equations from electrodynamics simulations, inventing numerical\nmethods for initial value problems, discovering Huffman coding for data\ncompression, and developing efficient sorting algorithms.

        "abstract": "$D^2$-sampling is a fundamental component of sampling-based clustering\nalgorithms such as $k$-means++. Given a dataset $V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ with\n$N$ points and a center set $C \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$, $D^2$-sampling refers to\npicking a point from $V$ where the sampling probability of a point is\nproportional to its squared distance from the nearest center in $C$. Starting\nwith empty $C$ and iteratively $D^2$-sampling and updating $C$ in $k$ rounds is\nprecisely $k$-means++ seeding that runs in $O(Nkd)$ time and gives\n$O(\\log{k})$-approximation in expectation for the $k$-means problem. We give a\nquantum algorithm for (approximate) $D^2$-sampling in the QRAM model that\nresults in a quantum implementation of $k$-means++ that runs in time\n$\\tilde{O}(\\zeta^2 k^2)$. Here $\\zeta$ is the aspect ratio (i.e., largest to\nsmallest interpoint distance), and $\\tilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors in\n$N, d, k$. It can be shown through a robust approximation analysis of\n$k$-means++ that the quantum version preserves its $O(\\log{k})$ approximation\nguarantee. Further, we show that our quantum algorithm for $D^2$-sampling can\nbe 'dequantized' using the sample-query access model of Tang (PhD Thesis, Ewin\nTang, University of Washington, 2023). This results in a fast quantum-inspired\nclassical implementation of $k$-means++, which we call QI-$k$-means++, with a\nrunning time $O(Nd) + \\tilde{O}(\\zeta^2k^2d)$, where the $O(Nd)$ term is for\nsetting up the sample-query access data structure. Experimental investigations\nshow promising results for QI-$k$-means++ on large datasets with bounded aspect\nratio. Finally, we use our quantum $D^2$-sampling with the known $\nD^2$-sampling-based classical approximation scheme (i.e.,\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation for any given $\\varepsilon>0$) to obtain the\nfirst quantum approximation scheme for the $k$-means problem with\npolylogarithmic running time dependence on $N$.",

        "abstract": "In resource allocation, we often require that the output allocation of an\nalgorithm is stable against input perturbation because frequent reallocation is\ncostly and untrustworthy. Varma and Yoshida (SODA'21) formalized this\nrequirement for algorithms as the notion of average sensitivity. Here, the\naverage sensitivity of an algorithm on an input instance is, roughly speaking,\nthe average size of the symmetric difference of the output for the instance and\nthat for the instance with one item deleted, where the average is taken over\nthe deleted item.\n  In this work, we consider the average sensitivity of the knapsack problem, a\nrepresentative example of a resource allocation problem. We first show a\n$(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the knapsack problem with average\nsensitivity $O(\\epsilon^{-1}\\log \\epsilon^{-1})$. Then, we complement this\nresult by showing that any $(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm has average\nsensitivity $\\Omega(\\epsilon^{-1})$. As an application of our algorithm, we\nconsider the incremental knapsack problem in the random-order setting, where\nthe goal is to maintain a good solution while items arrive one by one in a\nrandom order. Specifically, we show that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a\n$(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with amortized recourse\n$O(\\epsilon^{-1}\\log \\epsilon^{-1})$ and amortized update time $O(\\log\nn+f_\\epsilon)$, where $n$ is the total number of items and $f_\\epsilon>0$ is a\nvalue depending on $\\epsilon$.",

        "abstract": "Reducing wealth inequality and increasing utility are critical issues. This\nstudy reveals the effects of redistribution and consumption morals on wealth\ninequality and utility. To this end, we present a novel approach that couples\nthe dynamic model of capital, consumption, and utility in macroeconomics with\nthe interaction model of joint business and redistribution in econophysics.\nWith this approach, we calculate the capital (wealth), the utility based on\nconsumption, and the Gini index of these inequality using redistribution and\nconsumption thresholds as moral parameters. The results show that:\nunder-redistribution and waste exacerbate inequality; conversely,\nover-redistribution and stinginess reduce utility; and a balanced moderate\nmoral leads to achieve both reduced inequality and increased utility. These\nfindings provide renewed economic and numerical support for the moral\nimportance known from philosophy, anthropology, and religion. The revival of\nredistribution and consumption morals should promote the transformation to a\nhuman mutual-aid economy, as indicated by philosopher and anthropologist,\ninstead of the capitalist economy that has produced the current inequality. The\npractical challenge is to implement bottom-up social business, on a foothold of\nworker coops and platform cooperatives as a community against the state and the\nmarket, with moral consensus and its operation.",

        "abstract": "The Vision Transformer (ViT) has gained prominence for its superior\nrelational modeling prowess. However, its global attention mechanism's\nquadratic complexity poses substantial computational burdens. A common remedy\nspatially groups tokens for self-attention, reducing computational\nrequirements. Nonetheless, this strategy neglects semantic information in\ntokens, possibly scattering semantically-linked tokens across distinct groups,\nthus compromising the efficacy of self-attention intended for modeling\ninter-token dependencies. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a fast and\nbalanced clustering method, named \\textbf{S}emantic \\textbf{E}quitable\n\\textbf{C}lustering (SEC). SEC clusters tokens based on their global semantic\nrelevance in an efficient, straightforward manner.

Previous methods focus on\nsynthesizing gestures that are synchronized with speech rhythm, yet they\nfrequently overlook the inclusion of semantic gestures.

To address these issues, we introduce\nSIGGesture, a novel diffusion-based approach for synthesizing realistic\ngestures that are of both high quality and semantically pertinent.\nSpecifically, we firstly build a strong diffusion-based foundation model for\nrhythmical gesture synthesis by pre-training it on a collected large-scale\ndataset with pseudo labels. Secondly, we leverage the powerful generalization\ncapabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate proper semantic\ngestures for the various speech content.

        "abstract": "Fully Encrypted Protocols (FEPs) have arisen in practice as a technique to\navoid network censorship. Such protocols are designed to produce messages that\nappear completely random. This design hides communications metadata, such as\nversion and length fields, and makes it difficult to even determine what\nprotocol is being used. Moreover, these protocols frequently support padding to\nhide the length of protocol fields and the contained message. These techniques\nhave relevance well beyond censorship circumvention, as protecting protocol\nmetadata has security and privacy benefits for all Internet communications. The\nsecurity of FEP designs depends on cryptographic assumptions, but neither\nsecurity definitions nor proofs exist for them. We provide novel security\ndefinitions that capture the metadata-protection goals of FEPs. Our definitions\nare given in both the datastream and datagram settings, which model the\nubiquitous TCP and UDP interfaces available to protocol designers. We prove\nrelations among these new notions and existing security definitions. We further\npresent new FEP constructions and prove their security. Finally, we survey\nexisting FEP candidates and characterize the extent to which they satisfy FEP\nsecurity. We identify novel ways in which these protocols are identifiable,\nincluding their responses to the introduction of data errors and the sizes of\ntheir smallest protocol messages.",

Various deep\nlearning-based techniques proposed in the literature have made significant\nprogress in this field, however, they still face limitations in terms of\naccuracy due to the complex and variable nature of brain tumor morphology.

        "abstract": "Time Series Forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields such as\nindustrial equipment maintenance, meteorology, energy consumption, traffic flow\nand financial investment. However, despite their considerable advantages over\ntraditional statistical approaches, current deep learning-based predictive\nmodels often exhibit a significant deviation between their forecasting outcomes\nand the ground truth. This discrepancy is largely due to an insufficient\nemphasis on extracting the sequence's latent information, particularly its\nglobal information within the frequency domain and the relationship between\ndifferent variables. To address this issue, we propose a novel model\nFrequency-domain Attention In Two Horizons, which decomposes time series into\ntrend and seasonal components using a multi-scale sequence adaptive\ndecomposition and fusion architecture, and processes them separately. FAITH\nutilizes Frequency Channel feature Extraction Module and Frequency Temporal\nfeature Extraction Module to capture inter-channel relationships and temporal\nglobal information in the sequence, significantly improving its ability to\nhandle long-term dependencies and complex patterns. Furthermore, FAITH achieves\ntheoretically linear complexity by modifying the time-frequency domain\ntransformation method, effectively reducing computational costs. Extensive\nexperiments on 6 benchmarks for long-term forecasting and 3 benchmarks for\nshort-term forecasting demonstrate that FAITH outperforms existing models in\nmany fields, such as electricity, weather and traffic, proving its\neffectiveness and superiority both in long-term and short-term time series\nforecasting tasks.

To mitigate\nthese key issues (among others), an efficient probabilistic selection based\nconstrained multi-objective EA is proposed, referred to as PSCMOEA.

        "abstract": "By comparing constructions of block encoding given by [1-4], we propose a way\nto extract dequantizability from advancements in dequantization techniques that\nhave been led by Tang, as in [5]. Then we apply this notion to the\nsparse-access input model that is known to be BQP-complete in general, thereby\nconceived to be un-dequantizable. Our goal is to break down this belief by\nexamining the sparse-access input model's instances, particularly their input\nmatrices. In conclusion, this paper forms a dequantizability-verifying scheme\nthat can be applied whenever an input is given.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13272v1",
        "abstract": "Understanding the writing frame of news articles is vital for addressing\nsocial issues, and thus has attracted notable attention in the fields of\ncommunication studies. Yet, assessing such news article frames remains a\nchallenge due to the absence of a concrete and unified standard dataset that\nconsiders the comprehensive nuances within news content.\n  To address this gap, we introduce an extended version of a large labeled news\narticle dataset with 16,687 new labeled pairs. Leveraging the pairwise\ncomparison of news articles, our method frees the work of manual identification\nof frame classes in traditional news frame analysis studies. Overall we\nintroduce the most extensive cross-lingual news article similarity dataset\navailable to date with 26,555 labeled news article pairs across 10 languages.\nEach data point has been meticulously annotated according to a codebook\ndetailing eight critical aspects of news content, under a human-in-the-loop\nframework. Application examples demonstrate its potential in unearthing country\ncommunities within global news coverage, exposing media bias among news\noutlets, and quantifying the factors related to news creation. We envision that\nthis news similarity dataset will broaden our understanding of the media\necosystem in terms of news coverage of events and perspectives across\ncountries, locations, languages, and other social constructs. By doing so, it\ncan catalyze advancements in social science research and applied methodologies,\nthereby exerting a profound impact on our society.",

Also, we allow for a fairly general\nreconstruction operator $\\mathcal A$.

We consider the task of image reconstruction from discrete data\n$g_{j,k} = (\\mathcal R f)_{j,k} + \\eta_{j,k}$.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13268v1",
        "abstract": "Conformal prediction has emerged as an effective strategy for uncertainty\nquantification by modifying a model to output sets of labels instead of a\nsingle label. These prediction sets come with the guarantee that they contain\nthe true label with high probability. However, conformal prediction typically\nrequires a large calibration dataset of i.i.d. examples. We consider the online\nlearning setting, where examples arrive over time, and the goal is to construct\nprediction sets dynamically. Departing from existing work, we assume\nsemi-bandit feedback, where we only observe the true label if it is contained\nin the prediction set. For instance, consider calibrating a document retrieval\nmodel to a new domain; in this setting, a user would only be able to provide\nthe true label if the target document is in the prediction set of retrieved\ndocuments. We propose a novel conformal prediction algorithm targeted at this\nsetting, and prove that it obtains sublinear regret compared to the optimal\nconformal predictor. We evaluate our algorithm on a retrieval task and an image\nclassification task, and demonstrate that it empirically achieves good\nperformance.",

        "abstract": "The intersection of Astronomy and AI encounters significant challenges\nrelated to issues such as noisy backgrounds, lower resolution (LR), and the\nintricate process of filtering and archiving images from advanced telescopes\nlike the James Webb. Given the dispersion of raw images in feature space, we\nhave proposed a \\textit{two-stage augmentation framework} entitled as\n\\textbf{FLARE} based on \\underline{f}eature \\underline{l}earning and\n\\underline{a}ugmented \\underline{r}esolution \\underline{e}nhancement. We first\napply lower (LR) to higher resolution (HR) conversion followed by standard\naugmentations. Secondly, we integrate a diffusion approach to synthetically\ngenerate samples using class-concatenated prompts. By merging these two stages\nusing weighted percentiles, we realign the feature space distribution, enabling\na classification model to establish a distinct decision boundary and achieve\nsuperior generalization on various in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. We\nconducted experiments on several downstream cosmos datasets and on our\noptimally distributed \\textbf{SpaceNet} dataset across 8-class fine-grained and\n4-class macro classification tasks. FLARE attains the highest performance gain\nof 20.78\\% for fine-grained tasks compared to similar baselines, while across\ndifferent classification models, FLARE shows a consistent increment of an\naverage of +15\\%.

        "abstract": "Optimal management of traffic light timing is one of the most effective\nfactors in reducing urban traffic. In most old systems, fixed timing was used\nalong with human factors to control traffic, which is not very efficient in\nterms of time and cost. Nowadays, methods in the field of traffic management\nare based on the use of artificial intelligence. In this method, by using\nreal-time processing of video surveillance camera images along with\nreinforcement learning, the optimal timing of traffic lights is determined and\napplied according to several parameters. In the research, deep learning methods\nwere used in vehicle detection using the YOLOv9-C model to estimate the number\nand other characteristics of vehicles such as speed. Finally, by modeling\nvehicles in an urban environment simulator at OpenAI Gym using multi-factor\nreinforcement learning and the DQN Rainbow algorithm, timing is applied to\ntraffic lights at intersections. Additionally, the use of transfer learning\nalong with retraining the model on images of Iranian cars has increased the\naccuracy of the model. The results of the proposed method show a model that is\nreasonably accurate in both parts of analyzing surveillance cameras and finding\nthe optimal timing, and it has been observed that it has better accuracy than\nprevious research.",
