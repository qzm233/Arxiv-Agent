        "abstract": "The prevalence and harms of online misinformation is a perennial concern for\ninternet platforms, institutions and society at large. Over time, information\nshared online has become more media-heavy and misinformation has readily\nadapted to these new modalities. The rise of generative AI-based tools, which\nprovide widely-accessible methods for synthesizing realistic audio, images,\nvideo and human-like text, have amplified these concerns. Despite intense\npublic interest and significant press coverage, quantitative information on the\nprevalence and modality of media-based misinformation remains scarce. Here, we\npresent the results of a two-year study using human raters to annotate online\nmedia-based misinformation, mostly focusing on images, based on claims assessed\nin a large sample of publicly-accessible fact checks with the ClaimReview\nmarkup. We present an image typology, designed to capture aspects of the image\nand manipulation relevant to the image's role in the misinformation claim. We\nvisualize the distribution of these types over time. We show the rise of\ngenerative AI-based content in misinformation claims, and that its commonality\nis a relatively recent phenomenon, occurring significantly after heavy press\ncoverage. We also show \"simple\" methods dominated historically, particularly\ncontext manipulations, and continued to hold a majority as of the end of data\ncollection in November 2023. The dataset, Annotated Misinformation, Media-Based\n(AMMeBa), is publicly-available, and we hope that these data will serve as both\na means of evaluating mitigation methods in a realistic setting and as a\nfirst-of-its-kind census of the types and modalities of online misinformation.",

XPBD stands in contrast to other meshless methods, such as the\nMaterial Point Method (MPM). MPM is based on discretizing the weak form of\ngoverning partial differential equations within a continuum domain, coupled\nwith a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian method for tracking deformation gradients. In\ncontrast, XPBD generally entails applying specific constraints, whether hard or\ncompliant, to collections of point masses. This paper revisits this perception,\ninvestigating the potential of XPBD in handling inelastic materials that are\ndescribed with continuum mechanics based yield surfaces and elastoplastic flow\nrules. Our inspiration is that a robust estimation of the velocity gradient is\nkey to effectively tracking deformation gradients in any meshless context. By\nfurther incorporating implicit inelastic constitutive relationships, we\nintroduce an updated Lagrangian augmentation to XPBD. This enhancement enables\nthe simulation of elastoplastic, viscoplastic, and granular substances\nfollowing their standard constitutive laws.

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks trained in an end-to-end manner are proven to be\nefficient in a wide range of machine learning tasks. However, there is one\ndrawback of end-to-end learning: The learned features and information are\nimplicitly represented in neural network parameters, which cannot be used as\nregularities, concepts or knowledge to explicitly represent the data\nprobability distribution. To resolve this issue, we propose in this paper a new\nmachine learning theory, which defines in mathematics what are regularities.\nBriefly, regularities are concise representations of the non-random features,\nor 'non-randomness' in the data probability distribution. Combining with\ninformation theory, we claim that regularities can also be regarded as a small\namount of information encoding a large amount of information. Our theory is\nbased on spiking functions. That is, if a function can react to, or spike on\nspecific data samples more frequently than random noise inputs, we say that\nsuch a function discovers non-randomness from the data distribution, and\nencodes the non-randomness into regularities. Our theory also discusses\napplying multiple spiking functions to the same data distribution. In this\nprocess, we claim that the 'best' regularities, or the optimal spiking\nfunctions, are those who can capture the largest amount of information from the\ndata distribution, and then encode the captured information in the most concise\nway. Theorems and hypotheses are provided to describe in mathematics what are\n'best' regularities and optimal spiking functions. Finally, we propose a\nmachine learning approach, which can potentially obtain the optimal spiking\nfunctions regarding the given dataset in practice.",

        "abstract": "Gaussian process factor analysis (GPFA) is a latent variable modeling\ntechnique commonly used to identify smooth, low-dimensional latent trajectories\nunderlying high-dimensional neural recordings. Specifically, researchers model\nspiking rates as Gaussian observations, resulting in tractable inference.\nRecently, GPFA has been extended to model spike count data. However, due to the\nnon-conjugacy of the likelihood, the inference becomes intractable. Prior works\nrely on either black-box inference techniques, numerical integration or\npolynomial approximations of the likelihood to handle intractability. To\novercome this challenge, we propose a conditionally-conjugate Gaussian process\nfactor analysis (ccGPFA) resulting in both analytically and computationally\ntractable inference for modeling neural activity from spike count data. In\nparticular, we develop a novel data augmentation based method that renders the\nmodel conditionally conjugate. Consequently, our model enjoys the advantage of\nsimple closed-form updates using a variational EM algorithm. Furthermore, due\nto its conditional conjugacy, we show our model can be readily scaled using\nsparse Gaussian Processes and accelerated inference via natural gradients. To\nvalidate our method, we empirically demonstrate its efficacy through\nexperiments.",

To our knowledge, this is the first apples-to-apples\ncomparison of graph containers rather than overall systems, which include\nconfounding factors such as differences in algorithm implementations and\ninfrastructure.\n  We measure the running time of 10 highly-optimized algorithms across over 20\ndifferent containers and 10 graphs. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the\naverage algorithm running time does not differ much across containers,\nespecially those that support dynamic updates. Specifically, a simple container\nbased on an off-the-shelf B-tree is only 1.22x slower on average than a highly\noptimized static one. Moreover, we observe that simplifying a graph-container\nApplication Programming Interface (API) to only a few simple functions incurs a\nmere 1.16x slowdown compared to a complete API. Finally, we also measure\nbatch-insert throughput in dynamic-graph containers for a full picture of their\nperformance.\n  To perform the benchmarks, we introduce BYO, a unified framework that\nstandardizes evaluations of graph-algorithm performance across different graph\ncontainers. BYO extends the Graph Based Benchmark Suite (Dhulipala et al. 18),\na state-of-the-art graph algorithm benchmark, to easily plug into different\ndynamic graph containers and enable fair comparisons between them on a large\nsuite of graph algorithms. While several graph algorithm benchmarks have been\ndeveloped to date, to the best of our knowledge, BYO is the first system\ndesigned to benchmark graph containers",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer\nthe Big Five personality traits from free-form user interactions. The results\ndemonstrate that a chatbot powered by GPT-4 can infer personality with moderate\naccuracy, outperforming previous approaches drawing inferences from static text\ncontent. The accuracy of inferences varied across different conversational\nsettings. Performance was highest when the chatbot was prompted to elicit\npersonality-relevant information from users (mean r=.443, range=[.245, .640]),\nfollowed by a condition placing greater emphasis on naturalistic interaction\n(mean r=.218, range=[.066, .373]). Notably, the direct focus on personality\nassessment did not result in a less positive user experience, with participants\nreporting the interactions to be equally natural, pleasant, engaging, and\nhumanlike across both conditions. A chatbot mimicking ChatGPT's default\nbehavior of acting as a helpful assistant led to markedly inferior personality\ninferences and lower user experience ratings but still captured psychologically\nmeaningful information for some of the personality traits (mean r=.117,\nrange=[-.004, .209]). Preliminary analyses suggest that the accuracy of\npersonality inferences varies only marginally across different\nsocio-demographic subgroups. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs for\npsychological profiling based on conversational interactions.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) for control has become increasingly popular due\nto its ability to learn rich feedback policies that take into account\nuncertainty and complex representations of the environment. When considering\nsafety constraints, constrained optimization approaches, where agents are\npenalized for constraint violations, are commonly used. In such methods, if\nagents are initialized in, or must visit, states where constraint violation\nmight be inevitable, it is unclear how much they should be penalized. We\naddress this challenge by formulating a constraint on the counterfactual harm\nof the learned policy compared to a default, safe policy. In a philosophical\nsense this formulation only penalizes the learner for constraint violations\nthat it caused; in a practical sense it maintains feasibility of the optimal\ncontrol problem. We present simulation studies on a rover with uncertain road\nfriction and a tractor-trailer parking environment that demonstrate our\nconstraint formulation enables agents to learn safer policies than contemporary\nconstrained RL methods.",

        "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Cascades (RNC) are the class of recurrent neural networks\nwith no cyclic dependencies among recurrent neurons. Their subclass RNC+ with\npositive recurrent weights has been shown to be closely connected to the\nstar-free regular languages, which are the expressivity of many\nwell-established temporal logics. The existing expressivity results show that\nthe regular languages captured by RNC+ are the star-free ones, and they leave\nopen the possibility that RNC+ may capture languages beyond regular. We exclude\nthis possibility for languages that include an identity element, i.e., an input\nthat can occur an arbitrary number of times without affecting the output.\nNamely, in the presence of an identity element, we show that the languages\ncaptured by RNC+ are exactly the star-free regular languages. Identity elements\nare ubiquitous in temporal patterns, and hence our results apply to a large\nnumber of applications. The implications of our results go beyond expressivity.\nAt their core, we establish a close structural correspondence between RNC+ and\nsemiautomata cascades, showing that every neuron can be equivalently captured\nby a three-state semiautomaton. A notable consequence of this result is that\nRNC+ are no more succinct than cascades of three-state semiautomata.",

This problem has become even more relevant as researchers\nwielding large data-hungry learning methods seek new sources of training data\nfor physical decision-making systems. However, building simulation models is\noften still done by hand. A graphic designer and a simulation engineer work\nwith predefined assets to construct rich scenes with realistic dynamic and\nkinematic properties. While this may scale to small numbers of scenes, to\nachieve the generalization properties that are required for data-driven robotic\ncontrol, we require a pipeline that is able to synthesize large numbers of\nrealistic scenes, complete with 'natural' kinematic and dynamic structures. To\nattack this problem, we develop models for inferring structure and generating\nsimulation scenes from natural images, allowing for scalable scene generation\nfrom web-scale datasets. To train these image-to-simulation models, we show how\ncontrollable text-to-image generative models can be used in generating paired\ntraining data that allows for modeling of the inverse problem, mapping from\nrealistic images back to complete scene models. We show how this paradigm\nallows us to build large datasets of scenes in simulation with semantic and\nphysical realism. We present an integrated end-to-end pipeline that generates\nsimulation scenes complete with articulated kinematic and dynamic structures\nfrom real-world images and use these for training robotic control policies.

However, their performance in healthcare remains\nunder-investigated and potentially limited, due to i) they lack rich\ndomain-specific knowledge and medical reasoning skills; and ii) most\nstate-of-the-art LLMs are unimodal, text-only models that cannot directly\nprocess multimodal inputs. To this end, we propose a multimodal medical\ncollaborative reasoning framework \\textbf{MultiMedRes}, which incorporates a\nlearner agent to proactively gain essential information from domain-specific\nexpert models, to solve medical multimodal reasoning problems. Our method\nincludes three steps: i) \\textbf{Inquire}: The learner agent first decomposes\ngiven complex medical reasoning problems into multiple domain-specific\nsub-problems; ii) \\textbf{Interact}: The agent then interacts with\ndomain-specific expert models by repeating the ``ask-answer'' process to\nprogressively obtain different domain-specific knowledge; iii)\n\\textbf{Integrate}: The agent finally integrates all the acquired\ndomain-specific knowledge to accurately address the medical reasoning problem.\nWe validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of difference visual\nquestion answering for X-ray images. The experiments demonstrate that our\nzero-shot prediction achieves state-of-the-art performance, and even\noutperforms the fully supervised methods.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce Era3D, a novel multiview diffusion method that\ngenerates high-resolution multiview images from a single-view image. Despite\nsignificant advancements in multiview generation, existing methods still suffer\nfrom camera prior mismatch, inefficacy, and low resolution, resulting in\npoor-quality multiview images. Specifically, these methods assume that the\ninput images should comply with a predefined camera type, e.g. a perspective\ncamera with a fixed focal length, leading to distorted shapes when the\nassumption fails. Moreover, the full-image or dense multiview attention they\nemploy leads to an exponential explosion of computational complexity as image\nresolution increases, resulting in prohibitively expensive training costs. To\nbridge the gap between assumption and reality, Era3D first proposes a\ndiffusion-based camera prediction module to estimate the focal length and\nelevation of the input image, which allows our method to generate images\nwithout shape distortions. Furthermore, a simple but efficient attention layer,\nnamed row-wise attention, is used to enforce epipolar priors in the multiview\ndiffusion, facilitating efficient cross-view information fusion. Consequently,\ncompared with state-of-the-art methods, Era3D generates high-quality multiview\nimages with up to a 512*512 resolution while reducing computation complexity by\n12x times. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Era3D can reconstruct\nhigh-quality and detailed 3D meshes from diverse single-view input images,\nsignificantly outperforming baseline multiview diffusion methods.",

While in-context editing (ICE) is currently the most effective method\nfor knowledge editing (KE), it is constrained by the black-box modeling of LLMs\nand thus lacks interpretability. Our work aims to elucidate the superior\nperformance of ICE on the KE by analyzing the impacts of in-context new\nknowledge on token-wise distributions. We observe that despite a significant\nboost in logits of the new knowledge, the performance of is still hindered by\nstubborn knowledge. Stubborn knowledge refers to as facts that have gained\nexcessive confidence during pretraining, making it hard to edit effectively. To\naddress this issue and further enhance the performance of ICE, we propose a\nnovel approach termed $\\textbf{De}$coding by $\\textbf{C}$ontrasting\n$\\textbf{K}$nowledge (DeCK). DeCK derives the distribution of the next token by\ncontrasting the logits obtained from the newly edited knowledge guided by ICE\nwith those from the unedited parametric knowledge.

For\ninstance, it improves the performance of LLaMA3-8B-instruct on MQuAKE by up to\n219%, demonstrating its capability to strengthen ICE in the editing of stubborn\nknowledge.

        "abstract": "Continuous-time generative models, such as Flow Matching (FM), construct\nprobability paths to transport between one distribution and another through the\nsimulation-free learning of the neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs).\nDuring inference, however, the learned model often requires multiple neural\nnetwork evaluations to accurately integrate the flow, resulting in a slow\nsampling speed. We attribute the reason to the inherent (joint) heterogeneity\nof source and/or target distributions, namely the singularity problem, which\nposes challenges for training the neural ODEs effectively. To address this\nissue, we propose a more general framework, termed Switched FM (SFM), that\neliminates singularities via switching ODEs, as opposed to using a uniform ODE\nin FM. Importantly, we theoretically show that FM cannot transport between two\nsimple distributions due to the existence and uniqueness of initial value\nproblems of ODEs, while these limitations can be well tackled by SFM. From an\northogonal perspective, our framework can seamlessly integrate with the\nexisting advanced techniques, such as minibatch optimal transport, to further\nenhance the straightness of the flow, yielding a more efficient sampling\nprocess with reduced costs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly\nproposed SFM through several numerical examples.",

        "abstract": "Many recent studies have shown that the perception of speech can be decoded\nfrom brain signals and subsequently reconstructed as continuous language.\nHowever, there is a lack of neurological basis for how the semantic information\nembedded within brain signals can be used more effectively to guide language\nreconstruction. The theory of predictive coding suggests that human brain\nnaturally engages in continuously predicting future word representations that\nspan multiple timescales. This implies that the decoding of brain signals could\npotentially be associated with a predictable future. To explore the predictive\ncoding theory within the context of language reconstruction, this paper\nproposes a novel model \\textsc{PredFT} for jointly modeling neural decoding and\nbrain prediction. It consists of a main decoding network for language\nreconstruction and a side network for predictive coding. The side network\nobtains brain predictive coding representation from related brain regions of\ninterest with a multi-head self-attention module. This representation is fused\ninto the main decoding network with cross-attention to facilitate the language\nmodels' generation process. Experiments are conducted on the largest\nnaturalistic language comprehension fMRI dataset Narratives. \\textsc{PredFT}\nachieves current state-of-the-art decoding performance with a maximum BLEU-1\nscore of $27.8\\%$.",

These lattices provide tunable\nanisotropy by integrating architectural elements like ``nesting orders (NOs)''\nand corresponding ``nesting orientations (NORs),'' along with repetitive\nself-similar X-cross struts and three four-fold axes of symmetry, resulting in\na wide spectrum of lattice designs.

        "abstract": "Transformers have become foundational architectures for both natural language\nand computer vision tasks. However, the high computational cost makes it quite\nchallenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates\nthe computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e.,\nnormalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in\ntransformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic\ncalculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient\nBatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in\ntraining. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to\nprogressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training.\nMoreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple\nyet effective to achieve strong performance.

Specifically, the class of the sample\nshould depend on the points from its context distribution for better\ngeneralisation across distributions.\n  How does one achieve this? The key idea is to adapt the outputs of each\nneuron of the network to its context distribution. We propose quantile\nactivation, QACT, which, in simple terms, outputs the relative quantile of the\nsample in its context distribution, instead of the actual values in traditional\nnetworks.\n  The scope of this article is to validate the proposed activation across\nseveral experimental settings, and compare it with conventional techniques. For\nthis, we use the datasets developed to test robustness against distortions\nCIFAR10C, CIFAR100C, MNISTC, TinyImagenetC, and show that we achieve a\nsignificantly higher generalisation across distortions than the conventional\nclassifiers, across different architectures. Although this paper is only a\nproof of concept, we surprisingly find that this approach outperforms\nDINOv2(small) at large distortions, even though DINOv2 is trained with a far\nbigger network on a considerably larger dataset.",

        "abstract": "Analyzing the cardiovascular system condition via Electrocardiography (ECG)\nis a common and highly effective approach, and it has been practiced and\nperfected over many decades. ECG sensing is non-invasive and relatively easy to\nacquire, and yet it is still cumbersome for holter monitoring tests that may\nspan over hours and even days. A possible alternative in this context is\nPhotoplethysmography (PPG): An optically-based signal that measures blood\nvolume fluctuations, as typically sensed by conventional ``wearable devices''.\nWhile PPG presents clear advantages in acquisition, convenience, and\ncost-effectiveness, ECG provides more comprehensive information, allowing for a\nmore precise detection of heart conditions. This implies that a conversion from\nPPG to ECG, as recently discussed in the literature, inherently involves an\nunavoidable level of uncertainty. In this paper we introduce a novel\nmethodology for addressing the PPG-2-ECG conversion, and offer an enhanced\nclassification of cardiovascular conditions using the given PPG, all while\ntaking into account the uncertainties arising from the conversion process. We\nprovide a mathematical justification for our proposed computational approach,\nand present empirical studies demonstrating its superior performance compared\nto state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

        "abstract": "Monocular 360 depth estimation is challenging due to the inherent distortion\nof the equirectangular projection (ERP). This distortion causes a problem:\nspherical adjacent points are separated after being projected to the ERP plane,\nparticularly in the polar regions. To tackle this problem, recent methods\ncalculate the spherical neighbors in the tangent domain. However, as the\ntangent patch and sphere only have one common point, these methods construct\nneighboring spherical relationships around the common point. In this paper, we\npropose spherical fully-connected CRFs (SF-CRFs). We begin by evenly\npartitioning an ERP image with regular windows, where windows at the equator\ninvolve broader spherical neighbors than those at the poles. To improve the\nspherical relationships, our SF-CRFs enjoy two key components. Firstly, to\ninvolve sufficient spherical neighbors, we propose a Spherical Window Transform\n(SWT) module. This module aims to replicate the equator window's spherical\nrelationships to all other windows, leveraging the rotational invariance of the\nsphere. Remarkably, the transformation process is highly efficient, completing\nthe transformation of all windows in a 512X1024 ERP with 0.038 seconds on CPU.\nSecondly, we propose a Planar-Spherical Interaction (PSI) module to facilitate\nthe relationships between regular and transformed windows, which not only\npreserves the local details but also captures global structures. By building a\ndecoder based on the SF-CRFs blocks, we propose CRF360D, a novel 360 depth\nestimation framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse\ndatasets. Our CRF360D is compatible with different perspective image-trained\nbackbones (e.g., EfficientNet), serving as the encoder.",

In CF-mMIMO systems\nemploying frequency division duplexing, each access point (AP) relies on\nchannel information provided by its associated user equipments (UEs) for\nbeamforming design. Since the uplink control channel is typically shared among\nUEs, we take account of each AP's total feedback budget, which is distributed\namong its associated UEs. By employing the Saleh-Valenzuela multi-resolvable\npath channel model with different average path gains, we first identify\nnecessary feedback information for each UE, along with an appropriate codebook\nstructure. This structure facilitates adaptive quantization of multiple paths\nbased on their dominance. We then formulate a joint optimization problem\naddressing user-centric UE-AP association and feedback bit allocation. To\naddress this challenge, we analyze the impact of feedback bit allocation and\nderive our proposed scheme from the solution of an alternative optimization\nproblem aimed at devising long-term policies, explicitly considering the\neffects of feedback bit allocation.

However,\nmost existing attacks use visible patterns (e.g., a patch or image\ntransformations) as triggers, which are vulnerable to human inspection. In this\npaper, we propose a novel backdoor attack, making imperceptible changes.\nConcretely, our attack first utilizes the pre-trained victim model to extract\nlow-level and high-level semantic features from clean images and generates\ntrigger pattern associated with high-level features based on channel attention.\nThen, the encoder model generates poisoned images based on the trigger and\nextracted low-level semantic features without causing noticeable feature loss.\nWe evaluate our attack on three prominent image classification DNN across three\nstandard datasets.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11535v1",
        "abstract": "Proving equivalence between functional programs is a fundamental problem in\nprogram verification, which often amounts to reasoning about algebraic data\ntypes (ADTs) and compositions of structural recursions. Modern theorem provers\naddress this problem by applying structural induction, which is insufficient\nfor proving many equivalence theorems. In such cases, one has to invent a set\nof lemmas, prove these lemmas by additional induction, and use these lemmas to\nprove the original theorem. There is, however, a lack of systematic\nunderstanding of what lemmas are needed for inductive proofs and how these\nlemmas can be synthesized automatically. This paper presents directed lemma\nsynthesis, an effective approach to automating equivalence proofs by\ndiscovering critical lemmas using program synthesis techniques. We first\nidentify two induction-friendly forms of propositions that give formal\nguarantees to the progress of the proof. We then propose two tactics that\nsynthesize and apply lemmas, thereby transforming the proof goal into\ninduction-friendly forms. Both tactics reduce lemma synthesis to a specialized\nclass of program synthesis problems with efficient algorithms. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: Compared to\nstate-of-the-art equivalence checkers employing heuristic-based lemma\nenumeration, directed lemma synthesis saves 95.47% runtime on average and\nsolves 38 more tasks over an extended version of the standard benchmark set.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the prosperity of knowledge graph based\nrecommendation system (KGRS), which enriches the representation of users,\nitems, and entities by structural knowledge with striking improvement.\nNevertheless, its unaffordable computational cost still limits researchers from\nexploring more sophisticated models. We observe that the bottleneck for\ntraining efficiency arises from the knowledge graph, which is plagued by the\nwell-known issue of knowledge explosion. Recently, some works have attempted to\nslim the inflated KG via summarization techniques. However, these summarized\nnodes may ignore the collaborative signals and deviate from the facts that\nnodes in knowledge graph represent symbolic abstractions of entities from the\nreal-world. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel approach called\nKGTrimmer for knowledge graph pruning tailored for recommendation, to remove\nthe unessential nodes while minimizing performance degradation. Specifically,\nwe design an importance evaluator from a dual-view perspective. For the\ncollective view, we embrace the idea of collective intelligence by extracting\ncommunity consensus based on abundant collaborative signals, i.e. nodes are\nconsidered important if they attract attention of numerous users. For the\nholistic view, we learn a global mask to identify the valueless nodes from\ntheir inherent properties or overall popularity. Next, we build an end-to-end\nimportance-aware graph neural network, which injects filtered knowledge to\nenhance the distillation of valuable user-item collaborative signals.\nUltimately, we generate a pruned knowledge graph with lightweight, stable, and\nrobust properties to facilitate the following-up recommendation task. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets to prove the\neffectiveness and generalization ability of KGTrimmer.",

Compared with the previous learning paradigm of pre-training and\nfine-tuning by cross entropy loss, the recently proposed supervised contrastive\nlearning approach has received tremendous attention due to its powerful feature\nlearning capability and robustness. Although several studies have incorporated\nthis technique for text classification, some limitations remain.

Moreover, these models leverage separate classification branch\nwith cross entropy and supervised contrastive learning branch without explicit\nmutual guidance. To this end, we propose a novel model named SharpReCL for\nimbalanced text classification tasks.

        "abstract": "Image-text matching has been a long-standing problem, which seeks to connect\nvision and language through semantic understanding. Due to the capability to\nmanage large-scale raw data, unsupervised hashing-based approaches have gained\nprominence recently. They typically construct a semantic similarity structure\nusing the natural distance, which subsequently provides guidance to the model\noptimization process. However, the similarity structure could be biased at the\nboundaries of semantic distributions, causing error accumulation during\nsequential optimization. To tackle this, we introduce a novel hashing approach\ntermed Distribution-based Structure Mining with Consistency Learning (DEMO) for\nefficient image-text matching. From a statistical view, DEMO characterizes each\nimage using multiple augmented views, which are considered as samples drawn\nfrom its intrinsic semantic distribution. Then, we employ a non-parametric\ndistribution divergence to ensure a robust and precise similarity structure. In\naddition, we introduce collaborative consistency learning which not only\npreserves the similarity structure in the Hamming space but also encourages\nconsistency between retrieval distribution from different directions in a\nself-supervised manner. Through extensive experiments on three benchmark\nimage-text matching datasets, we demonstrate that DEMO achieves superior\nperformance compared with many state-of-the-art methods.",

Unlike traditional approaches and existing learning-based\nmethods, our framework utilizes two coordinate-based neural networks to\nimplicitly represent a voxelized point cloud. The first network generates the\noccupancy status of a voxel, while the second network determines the attributes\nof an occupied voxel. To tackle an immense number of voxels within the\nvolumetric space, we partition the space into smaller cubes and focus solely on\nvoxels within non-empty cubes. By feeding the coordinates of these voxels into\nthe respective networks, we reconstruct the geometry and attribute components\nof the original point cloud. The neural network parameters are further\nquantized and compressed. Experimental results underscore the superior\nperformance of our proposed method compared to the octree-based approach\nemployed in the latest G-PCC standards.

The proposed\napproach utilises voxelised models to discretise the vehicle geometry into a\ngrid of voxels, allowing for a detailed representation of the aerodynamic flow\nfield. The Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithm is then employed to\ntrain a DRL agent to optimise the design parameters of the vehicle with respect\nto drag force, kinetic energy, and voxel collision count. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach in\nachieving significant results in aerodynamic performance.

        "abstract": "Synthetic image attribution addresses the problem of tracing back the origin\nof images produced by generative models. Extensive efforts have been made to\nexplore unique representations of generative models and use them to attribute a\nsynthetic image to the model that produced it. Most of the methods classify the\nmodels or the architectures among those in a closed set without considering the\npossibility that the system is fed with samples produced by unknown\narchitectures. With the continuous progress of AI technology, new generative\narchitectures continuously appear, thus driving the attention of researchers\ntowards the development of tools capable of working in open-set scenarios. In\nthis paper, we propose a framework for open set attribution of synthetic\nimages, named BOSC (Backdoor-based Open Set Classification), that relies on the\nconcept of backdoor attacks to design a classifier with rejection option. BOSC\nworks by purposely injecting class-specific triggers inside a portion of the\nimages in the training set to induce the network to establish a matching\nbetween class features and trigger features. The behavior of the trained model\nwith respect to triggered samples is then exploited at test time to perform\nsample rejection using an ad-hoc score. Experiments show that the proposed\nmethod has good performance, always surpassing the state-of-the-art. Robustness\nagainst image processing is also very good. Although we designed our method for\nthe task of synthetic image attribution, the proposed framework is a general\none and can be used for other image forensic applications.",

        "abstract": "Characters are an important aspect of any storyline and identifying and\nincluding them in descriptions is necessary for story understanding. While\nprevious work has largely ignored identity and generated captions with someone\n(anonymized names), recent work formulates id-aware captioning as a\nfill-in-the-blanks (FITB) task, where, given a caption with blanks, the goal is\nto predict person id labels. However, to predict captions with ids, a two-stage\napproach is required: first predict captions with someone, then fill in\nidentities. In this work, we present a new single stage approach that can\nseamlessly switch between id-aware caption generation or FITB when given a\ncaption with blanks. Our model, Movie-Identity Captioner (MICap), uses a shared\nauto-regressive decoder that benefits from training with FITB and full-caption\ngeneration objectives, while the encoder can benefit from or disregard captions\nwith blanks as input. Another challenge with id-aware captioning is the lack of\na metric to capture subtle differences between person ids. To this end, we\nintroduce iSPICE, a caption evaluation metric that focuses on identity tuples\ncreated through intermediate scene graphs. We evaluate MICap on Large-Scale\nMovie Description Challenge (LSMDC), where we show a 4.2% improvement in FITB\naccuracy, and a 1-2% bump in classic captioning metrics.",

        "abstract": "The credibility and practicality of a reconstructed hand-object interaction\nsequence depend largely on its physical plausibility. However, due to high\nocclusions during hand-object interaction, physical plausibility remains a\nchallenging criterion for purely vision-based tracking methods. To address this\nissue and enhance the results of existing hand trackers, this paper proposes a\nnovel physically-aware hand motion de-noising method. Specifically, we\nintroduce two learned loss terms that explicitly capture two crucial aspects of\nphysical plausibility: grasp credibility and manipulation feasibility. These\nterms are used to train a physically-aware de-noising network. Qualitative and\nquantitative experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves\nboth fine-grained physical plausibility and overall pose accuracy, surpassing\ncurrent state-of-the-art de-noising methods.",

        "abstract": "Driven by large data trained segmentation models, such as SAM , research in\none-shot segmentation has experienced significant advancements. Recent\ncontributions like PerSAM and MATCHER , presented at ICLR 2024, utilize a\nsimilar approach by leveraging SAM with one or a few reference images to\ngenerate high quality segmentation masks for target images. Specifically, they\nutilize raw encoded features to compute cosine similarity between patches\nwithin reference and target images along the channel dimension, effectively\ngenerating prompt points or boxes for the target images a technique referred to\nas the matching strategy. However, relying solely on raw features might\nintroduce biases and lack robustness for such a complex task. To address this\nconcern, we delve into the issues of feature interaction and uneven\ndistribution inherent in raw feature based matching. In this paper, we propose\na simple and training-free method to enhance the validity and robustness of the\nmatching strategy at no additional computational cost (NubbleDrop). The core\nconcept involves randomly dropping feature channels (setting them to zero)\nduring the matching process, thereby preventing models from being influenced by\nchannels containing deceptive information.

The existence of a $1$-cover defines a well-known class of\nquasi-periodic strings. Quasi-periodicity can be decided in linear time, and\nall $1$-covers of a string can be reported in linear time plus the size of the\noutput. Since in general it is NP-complete to decide whether a string has a\n$\\lambda$-cover, the natural next step is the development of efficient\nalgorithms for $2$-covers. Radoszewski and Straszy\\'nski [ESA 2020] analysed\nthe particular case where the strings in a $2$-cover must be of the same\nlength. They provided an algorithm that reports all such $2$-covers of $S$ in\ntime near-linear in $|S|$ and in the size of the output.\n  In this work, we consider $2$-covers in full generality. Since every\nlength-$n$ string has $\\Omega(n^2)$ trivial $2$-covers (every prefix and suffix\nof total length at least $n$ constitute such a $2$-cover), we state the\nreporting problem as follows: given a string $S$ and a number $m$, report all\n$2$-covers $\\{C_1,C_2\\}$ of $S$ with length $|C_1|+|C_2|$ upper bounded by $m$.\nWe present an $\\tilde{O}(n + Output)$ time algorithm solving this problem, with\nOutput being the size of the output. This algorithm admits a simpler\nmodification that finds a $2$-cover of minimum length. We also provide an\n$\\tilde{O}(n)$ time construction of a $2$-cover oracle which, given two\nsubstrings $C_1,C_2$ of $S$, reports in poly-logarithmic time whether\n$\\{C_1,C_2\\}$ is a $2$-cover of $S$.",

In this paper, we propose an efficient and\neffective framework to adapt to varying degrees of degradation across different\nregions for image restoration. Specifically, we design a spatial and frequency\nattention mechanism (SFAM) to emphasize crucial features for restoration. SFAM\nconsists of two modules: the spatial domain attention module (SDAM) and the\nfrequency domain attention module (FDAM). The SFAM discerns the degradation\nlocation through spatial selective attention and channel selective attention in\nthe spatial domain, while the FDAM enhances high-frequency signals to amplify\nthe disparities between sharp and degraded image pairs in the spectral domain.\nAdditionally, to capture global range information, we introduce a multi-scale\nblock (MSBlock) that consists of three scale branches, each containing multiple\nsimplified channel attention blocks (SCABlocks) and a multi-scale feed-forward\nblock (MSFBlock).

Instead, it attaches a soft\nprompt to the input text, whereby downstream tasks can be well adapted by\nmerely learning the embeddings of prompt tokens. Nevertheless, existing methods\nstill suffer from two challenges: (i) they are hard to balance accuracy and\nefficiency. A longer (shorter) soft prompt generally leads to a better (worse)\naccuracy but at the cost of more (less) training time.

The accuracy is also enhanced by leveraging low-rank matrices\nand the short prompt as additional knowledge sources to enrich the semantics of\nthe original short prompt.

        "abstract": "We explore the usage of large language models (LLM) in human-in-the-loop\nhuman-in-the-plant cyber-physical systems (CPS) to translate a high-level\nprompt into a personalized plan of actions, and subsequently convert that plan\ninto a grounded inference of sequential decision-making automated by a\nreal-world CPS controller to achieve a control goal. We show that it is\nrelatively straightforward to contextualize an LLM so it can generate\ndomain-specific plans. However, these plans may be infeasible for the physical\nsystem to execute or the plan may be unsafe for human users. To address this,\nwe propose CPS-LLM, an LLM retrained using an instruction tuning framework,\nwhich ensures that generated plans not only align with the physical system\ndynamics of the CPS but are also safe for human users. The CPS-LLM consists of\ntwo innovative components: a) a liquid time constant neural network-based\nphysical dynamics coefficient estimator that can derive coefficients of\ndynamical models with some unmeasured state variables; b) the model\ncoefficients are then used to train an LLM with prompts embodied with traces\nfrom the dynamical system and the corresponding model coefficients. We show\nthat when the CPS-LLM is integrated with a contextualized chatbot such as BARD\nit can generate feasible and safe plans to manage external events such as meals\nfor automated insulin delivery systems used by Type 1 Diabetes subjects.",

We propose a novel multi-factor fuzzy extractor that\nintegrates both a user's secret (e.g., a password) and a user's biometrics in\nthe generation and reconstruction process of a cryptographic key. We then\nemploy this multi-factor fuzzy extractor to construct personal identity\ncredentials which can be used in a new multi-factor authenticated key exchange\nprotocol that possesses multiple important features. First, the protocol\nprovides mutual authentication. Second, the user and service provider can\nauthenticate each other without the involvement of the identity authority.\nThird, the protocol can prevent user impersonation from a compromised identity\nauthority. Finally, even when both a biometric sample and the secret are\ncaptured, the user can re-register to create a new credential using a new\nsecret (reusable/reissued identity credentials). Most existing works on\nmulti-factor authenticated key exchange only have a subset of these features.\nWe formally prove that the proposed protocol is semantically secure.

To address these challenges, we propose NetMamba, an efficient\nlinear-time state space model equipped with a comprehensive traffic\nrepresentation scheme.

Evaluation experiments on six public datasets encompassing three\nmain classification tasks showcase NetMamba's superior classification\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

To\nlearn a robust LLM that adapts well to unseen tasks, multiple meta-training\napproaches have been proposed such as MetaICL and MetaICT, which involve\nmeta-training pre-trained LLMs on a wide variety of diverse tasks. These\nmeta-training approaches essentially perform in-context multi-task fine-tuning\nand evaluate on a disjointed test set of tasks.

In this paper, we introduce\nPQ3D, a unified model capable of using Promptable Queries to tackle a wide\nrange of 3D-VL tasks, from low-level instance segmentation to high-level\nreasoning and planning. This is achieved through three key innovations: (1)\nunifying various 3D scene representations (i.e., voxels, point clouds,\nmulti-view images) into a shared 3D coordinate space by segment-level grouping,\n(2) an attention-based query decoder for task-specific information retrieval\nguided by prompts, and (3) universal output heads for different tasks to\nsupport multi-task training.

        "abstract": "In real-world applications of human pose estimation, low-resolution input\nimages are frequently encountered when the performance of the image acquisition\nequipment is limited or the shooting distance is too far. However, existing\nstate-of-the-art models for human pose estimation perform poorly on\nlow-resolution images. One key reason is the presence of downsampling layers in\nthese models, e.g., strided convolutions and pooling layers. It further reduces\nthe already insufficient image information. Another key reason is that the body\nskeleton and human kinematic information are not fully utilized. In this work,\nwe propose a Multi-Granular Information-Lossless (MGIL) model to replace the\ndownsampling layers to address the above issues. Specifically, MGIL employs a\nFine-grained Lossless Information Extraction (FLIE) module, which can prevent\nthe loss of local information.

        "abstract": "As a distributed machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) is\ncollaboratively carried out on privately owned datasets but without direct data\naccess. Although the original intention is to allay data privacy concerns,\n\"available but not visible\" data in FL potentially brings new security threats,\nparticularly poisoning attacks that target such \"not visible\" local data.\nInitial attempts have been made to conduct data poisoning attacks against FL\nsystems, but cannot be fully successful due to their high chance of causing\nstatistical anomalies. To unleash the potential for truly \"invisible\" attacks\nand build a more deterrent threat model, in this paper, a new data poisoning\nattack model named VagueGAN is proposed, which can generate seemingly\nlegitimate but noisy poisoned data by untraditionally taking advantage of\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) variants. Capable of manipulating the\nquality of poisoned data on demand, VagueGAN enables to trade-off attack\neffectiveness and stealthiness. Furthermore, a cost-effective countermeasure\nnamed Model Consistency-Based Defense (MCD) is proposed to identify\nGAN-poisoned data or models after finding out the consistency of GAN outputs.\nExtensive experiments on multiple datasets indicate that our attack method is\ngenerally much more stealthy as well as more effective in degrading FL\nperformance with low complexity. Our defense method is also shown to be more\ncompetent in identifying GAN-poisoned data or models.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12954v2",
        "abstract": "The success of artificial neural networks (ANNs) hinges greatly on the\njudicious selection of an activation function, introducing non-linearity into\nnetwork and enabling them to model sophisticated relationships in data.\nHowever, the search of activation functions has largely relied on empirical\nknowledge in the past, lacking theoretical guidance, which has hindered the\nidentification of more effective activation functions. In this work, we offer a\nproper solution to such issue. Firstly, we theoretically demonstrate the\nexistence of the worst activation function with boundary conditions (WAFBC)\nfrom the perspective of information entropy. Furthermore, inspired by the\nTaylor expansion form of information entropy functional, we propose the\nEntropy-based Activation Function Optimization (EAFO) methodology. EAFO\nmethodology presents a novel perspective for designing static activation\nfunctions in deep neural networks and the potential of dynamically optimizing\nactivation during iterative training. Utilizing EAFO methodology, we derive a\nnovel activation function from ReLU, known as Correction Regularized ReLU\n(CRReLU). Experiments conducted with vision transformer and its variants on\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nCRReLU over existing corrections of ReLU. Extensive empirical studies on task\nof large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, CRReLU exhibits superior performance\ncompared to GELU, suggesting its broader potential for practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved\ncode generation, specifically at the function level. For instance, GPT-4 has\nachieved an 88.4% pass rate on HumanEval. However, this draws into question the\nadequacy of existing benchmarks in thoroughly assessing function-level code\ngeneration capabilities. Our study analyzed two common benchmarks, HumanEval\nand MBPP, and found that these might not thoroughly evaluate LLMs' code\ngeneration capacities due to limitations in quality, difficulty, and\ngranularity. To resolve this, we introduce the Mostly Hard Python Problems\n(MHPP) dataset, consisting of 140 unique human-curated problems. By focusing on\nthe combination of natural language and code reasoning, MHPP gauges LLMs'\nabilities to comprehend specifications and restrictions, engage in multi-step\nreasoning, and apply coding knowledge effectively. Initial evaluations of 22\nLLMs using MHPP showed many high-performing models on HumanEval failed to\nachieve similar success on MHPP. Moreover, MHPP highlighted various previously\nundiscovered limitations within various LLMs, leading us to believe that it\ncould pave the way for a better understanding of LLMs' capabilities and\nlimitations.

In particular, resolving sets can be used to represent points in\nabstract metric spaces as Euclidean vectors. Importantly, due to the triangle\ninequality, points close by in the space are represented as vectors with\nsimilar coordinates, which may find applications in classification problems of\nsymbolic objects under suitably chosen metrics. In this manuscript, we address\nthe resolvability of Jaccard spaces, i.e., metric spaces of the form\n$(2^X,\\text{Jac})$, where $2^X$ is the power set of a finite set $X$, and\n$\\text{Jac}$ is the Jaccard distance between subsets of $X$.

We combine probabilistic and linear algebra arguments to\nconstruct highly likely but nearly optimal (i.e., of minimal size) resolving\nsets of $(2^X,\\text{Jac})$.

        "abstract": "In-context learning enables large language models (LLMs) to perform a variety\nof tasks, including learning to make reward-maximizing choices in simple bandit\ntasks. Given their potential use as (autonomous) decision-making agents, it is\nimportant to understand how these models perform such reinforcement learning\n(RL) tasks and the extent to which they are susceptible to biases. Motivated by\nthe fact that, in humans, it has been widely documented that the value of an\noutcome depends on how it compares to other local outcomes, the present study\nfocuses on whether similar value encoding biases apply to how LLMs encode\nrewarding outcomes. Results from experiments with multiple bandit tasks and\nmodels show that LLMs exhibit behavioral signatures of a relative value bias.\nAdding explicit outcome comparisons to the prompt produces opposing effects on\nperformance, enhancing maximization in trained choice sets but impairing\ngeneralization to new choice sets. Computational cognitive modeling reveals\nthat LLM behavior is well-described by a simple RL algorithm that incorporates\nrelative values at the outcome encoding stage. Lastly, we present preliminary\nevidence that the observed biases are not limited to fine-tuned LLMs, and that\nrelative value processing is detectable in the final hidden layer activations\nof a raw, pretrained model. These findings have important implications for the\nuse of LLMs in decision-making applications.",

They disregard the actual welfare consequences of decisions and may\ntherefore fail to achieve the kind of fairness that is desired for\ndisadvantaged groups. In addition, they are often incompatible with each other,\nand there is no convincing justification for selecting one rather than another.\nThis paper explores whether a broader conception of social justice, based on\noptimizing a social welfare function (SWF), can be useful for assessing various\ndefinitions of parity. We focus on the well-known alpha fairness SWF, which has\nbeen defended by axiomatic and bargaining arguments over a period of 70 years.\nWe analyze the optimal solution and show that it can justify demographic parity\nor equalized odds under certain conditions, but frequently requires a departure\nfrom these types of parity. In addition, we find that predictive rate parity is\nof limited usefulness. These results suggest that optimization theory can shed\nlight on the intensely discussed question of how to achieve group fairness in\nAI.",
