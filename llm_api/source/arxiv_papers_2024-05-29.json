        "abstract": "Recently, various methods have been proposed to solve Image Restoration (IR)\ntasks using a pre-trained diffusion model leading to state-of-the-art\nperformance. However, most of these methods assume that the degradation\noperator in the IR task is completely known. Furthermore, a common\ncharacteristic among these approaches is that they alter the diffusion sampling\nprocess in order to satisfy the consistency with the degraded input image. This\nchoice has recently been shown to be sub-optimal and to cause the restored\nimage to deviate from the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose\nBlind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method\nthat jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored\nimage. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we\npropose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea\nin our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, i.e., not to alter all the\nintermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately\nequivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of\nthe input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with\ninverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability\nof these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time\nsteps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and\nshow that it achieves state of the art performance on all of them.

Ensembling is by refining\neach predicted start point, then choosing the best by fitting loss.

        "abstract": "Evolutionary game dynamics on networks typically consider the competition\namong simple strategies such as cooperation and defection in the Prisoner's\nDilemma and summarize the effect of population structure as network\nreciprocity. However, it remains largely unknown regarding the evolutionary\ndynamics involving multiple powerful strategies typically considered in\nrepeated games, such as the zero-determinant (ZD) strategies that are able to\nenforce a linear payoff relationship between them and their co-players. Here,\nwe consider the evolutionary dynamics of always cooperate (AllC), extortionate\nZD (extortioners), and unbending players in lattice populations based on the\ncommonly used death-birth updating. Out of the class of unbending strategies,\nwe consider a particular candidate, PSO Gambler, a machine-learning-optimized\nmemory-one strategy, which can foster reciprocal cooperation and fairness among\nextortionate players. We derive analytical results under weak selection and\nrare mutations, including pairwise fixation probabilities and long-term\nfrequencies of strategies. In the absence of the third unbending type,\nextortioners can achieve a half-half split in equilibrium with unconditional\ncooperators for sufficiently large extortion factors. However, the presence of\nunbending players fundamentally changes the dynamics and tilts the system to\nfavor unbending cooperation. Most surprisingly, extortioners cannot dominate at\nall regardless of how large their extortion factor is, and the long-term\nfrequency of unbending players is maintained almost as a constant. Our\nanalytical method is applicable to studying the evolutionary dynamics of\nmultiple strategies in structured populations. Our work provides insights into\nthe interplay between network reciprocity and direct reciprocity, revealing the\nrole of unbending strategies in enforcing fairness and suppressing extortion.",

        "abstract": "The diffusion of information plays a crucial role in a society,\ncharacterizing the diffusion process is challenging because it is highly\nnon-stationary and varies with the media type. To understand the spreading of\nnewspaper news in Argentina, we collected data from more than 27000 articles\npublished in six main provinces during four months. We classified the articles\ninto 20 thematic axes and obtained a set of 120 time series that capture daily\nnewspaper attention on different topics in different provinces. To analyze the\ndata we use a point process approach. For each topic, $n$, and for all pairs of\nprovinces, $i$ and $j$, we use two measures to quantify the synchronicity of\nthe events, $Q_s(i,j)$, which quantifies the number of events that occur almost\nsimultaneously in $i$ and $j$, and $Q_a(i,j)$, which quantifies the direction\nof news spreading. We also analyze the dataset using well-known measures to\ndetect correlations and dependencies, computed from the raw time series:\nundirected measures (linear cross-correlation, $CC$, and nonlinear mutual\ninformation, $MI$) and directed measures (linear Granger causality, $GC$, and\nnonlinear Transfer entropy, $TE$). Our analysis unveils how fast the\ninformation diffusion process is, as high values of $Q_{s}$, $CC$, and $MI$\nreveal pairs of provinces with very similar and almost simultaneous temporal\nvariations of media attention. On the other hand, $GC$ and $TE$ do not perform\nwell in this context because they often return opposite directions of\ninformation transfer. We interpret this as due to three main factors: the\ncharacteristics of the data, which is highly non-stationary, the\ncharacteristics of the information diffusion process, which is very fast and\nprobably acts at a sub-resolution time scale, and the action of large media\ncompanies that act as global, external drivers of information dissemination.",

        "abstract": "To determine the safety of large language models (LLMs), AI developers must\nbe able to assess their dangerous capabilities. But simple prompting strategies\noften fail to elicit an LLM's full capabilities. One way to elicit capabilities\nmore robustly is to fine-tune the LLM to complete the task. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the conditions under which fine-tuning-based elicitation suffices\nto elicit capabilities. To do this, we introduce password-locked models, LLMs\nfine-tuned such that some of their capabilities are deliberately hidden.\nSpecifically, these LLMs are trained to exhibit these capabilities only when a\npassword is present in the prompt, and to imitate a much weaker LLM otherwise.\nPassword-locked models enable a novel method of evaluating capabilities\nelicitation methods, by testing whether these password-locked capabilities can\nbe elicited without using the password. We find that a few high-quality\ndemonstrations are often sufficient to fully elicit password-locked\ncapabilities. More surprisingly, fine-tuning can elicit other capabilities that\nhave been locked using the same password, or even different passwords.\nFurthermore, when only evaluations, and not demonstrations, are available,\napproaches like reinforcement learning are still often able to elicit\ncapabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that fine-tuning is an effective\nmethod of eliciting hidden capabilities of current models, but may be\nunreliable when high-quality demonstrations are not available, e.g. as may be\nthe case when models' (hidden) capabilities exceed those of human\ndemonstrators.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19547v1",
        "abstract": "Data selection has emerged as a core issue for large-scale visual-language\nmodel pretaining (e.g., CLIP), particularly with noisy web-curated datasets.\nThree main data selection approaches are: (1) leveraging external non-CLIP\nmodels to aid data selection, (2) training new CLIP-style embedding models that\nare more effective at selecting high-quality data than the original OpenAI CLIP\nmodel, and (3) designing better metrics or strategies universally applicable to\nany CLIP embedding without requiring specific model properties (e.g., CLIPScore\nis one popular metric). While the first two approaches have been extensively\nstudied, the third remains under-explored. In this paper, we advance the third\napproach by proposing two new methods. Firstly, instead of classical CLIP\nscores that only consider the alignment between two modalities from a single\nsample, we introduce negCLIPLoss, a CLIP loss-inspired method that adds the\nalignment between one sample and its contrastive pairs as an extra\nnormalization term for better quality measurement. Secondly, when downstream\ntasks are known, we propose a new norm-based metric, NormSim, to measure the\nsimilarity between pretraining data and target data. We test our methods on the\ndata selection benchmark, DataComp~\\cite{gadre2023datacomp}. Compared to the\nbest baseline using only OpenAI's CLIP-L/14, our methods achieve a 5.3\\%\nimprovement on ImageNet-1k and a 2.8\\% improvement on 38 downstream evaluation\ntasks. Moreover, both negCLIPLoss and NormSim are compatible with existing\ntechniques. By combining our methods with the current best methods\nDFN~\\cite{fang2023data} and HYPE~\\cite{kim2024hype}, we can boost average\nperformance on downstream tasks by 0.9\\%, achieving a new state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "The growing safety concerns surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) raise an\nurgent need to align them with diverse human preferences to simultaneously\nenhance their helpfulness and safety. A promising approach is to enforce safety\nconstraints through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). For such\nconstrained RLHF, common Lagrangian-based primal-dual policy optimization\nmethods are computationally expensive and often unstable. This paper presents a\ndualization perspective that reduces constrained alignment to an equivalent\nunconstrained alignment problem. We do so by pre-optimizing a smooth and convex\ndual function that has a closed form. This shortcut eliminates the need for\ncumbersome primal-dual policy iterations, thus greatly reducing the\ncomputational burden and improving training stability. Our strategy leads to\ntwo practical algorithms in model-based and preference-based scenarios (MoCAN\nand PeCAN, respectively).

        "abstract": "Accurate bone tracking is crucial for kinematic analysis in orthopedic\nsurgery and prosthetic robotics. Traditional methods (e.g., skin markers) are\nsubject to soft tissue artifacts, and the bone pins used in surgery introduce\nthe risk of additional trauma and infection. For electromyography (EMG), its\ninability to directly measure joint angles requires complex algorithms for\nkinematic estimation. To address these issues, A-mode ultrasound-based tracking\nhas been proposed as a non-invasive and safe alternative. However, this\napproach suffers from limited accuracy in peak detection when processing\nreceived ultrasound signals. To build a precise and real-time bone tracking\napproach, this paper introduces a deep learning-based method for anatomical\nregion recognition and bone tracking using A-mode ultrasound signals,\nspecifically focused on the knee joint. The algorithm is capable of\nsimultaneously performing bone tracking and identifying the anatomical region\nwhere the A-mode ultrasound transducer is placed. It contains the fully\nconnection between all encoding and decoding layers of the cascaded U-Nets to\nfocus only on the signal region that is most likely to have the bone peak, thus\npinpointing the exact location of the peak and classifying the anatomical\nregion of the signal. The experiment showed a 97% accuracy in the\nclassification of the anatomical regions and a precision of around 0.5$\\pm$1mm\nunder dynamic tracking conditions for various anatomical areas surrounding the\nknee joint. In general, this approach shows great potential beyond the\ntraditional method, in terms of the accuracy achieved and the recognition of\nthe anatomical region where the ultrasound has been attached as an additional\nfunctionality.",

We attribute this discrepancy to the\nDPO objective, which is empirically and theoretically ill-suited to fix even\nmild ranking errors in the reference model, and derive a simple and efficient\nformula for quantifying the difficulty of learning a given preference\ndatapoint. Finally, we demonstrate that ranking accuracy strongly correlates\nwith the empirically popular win rate metric when the model is close to the\nreference model used in the objective, shedding further light on the\ndifferences between on-policy (e.g., RLHF) and off-policy (e.g., DPO)\npreference learning algorithms.",

We propose the multi-marginal matching gap (M3G), a loss that borrows\ntools from multi-marginal optimal transport (MM-OT) theory to simultaneously\nincorporate all $k$ views. Given a batch of $n$ points, each seen as a\n$k$-tuple of views subsequently transformed into $k$ embeddings, our loss\ncontrasts the cost of matching these $n$ ground-truth $k$-tuples with the MM-OT\npolymatching cost, which seeks $n$ optimally arranged $k$-tuples chosen within\nthese $n\\times k$ vectors. While the exponential complexity $O(n^k$) of the\nMM-OT problem may seem daunting, we show in experiments that a suitable\ngeneralization of the Sinkhorn algorithm for that problem can scale to, e.g.,\n$k=3\\sim 6$ views using mini-batches of size $64~\\sim128$.

To help evaluate integrated FRT and microtransit public transit\n(PT) system (henceforth ``integrated fixed-flex PT system'') designs, we\npropose a high-fidelity modeling framework that provides reliable estimates for\na wide range of (i) performance metrics and (ii) integrated fixed-flex PT\nsystem designs. We formulate the mode choice equilibrium problem as a\nfixed-point problem wherein microtransit demand is a function of microtransit\nperformance, and microtransit performance depends on microtransit demand. We\npropose a detailed agent-based simulation modeling framework that includes (i)\na binary logit mode choice model (private auto vs. transit), (ii) a\nsupernetwork-based model and pathfinding algorithm for multi-modal transit path\nchoice where the supernetwork includes pedestrian, FRT, and microtransit\nlayers, (iii) a detailed mobility-on-demand fleet simulator called FleetPy to\nmodel the supply-demand dynamics of the microtransit service. In this paper, we\nillustrate the capabilities of the modeling framework by analyzing integrated\nfixed-flex PT system designs that vary the following design parameters: FRT\nfrequencies and microtransit fleet size, service region structure, virtual stop\ncoverage, and operating hours. We include case studies in downtown San Diego\nand Lemon Grove, California. The computational results show that the proposed\nmodeling framework converges to a mode choice equilibrium.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19525v1",
        "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art video object segmentation models have achieved great\nsuccess using supervised learning with massive labeled training datasets.\nHowever, these models are trained using a single source domain and evaluated\nusing videos sampled from the same source domain. When these models are\nevaluated using videos sampled from a different target domain, their\nperformance degrades significantly due to poor domain generalization, i.e.,\ntheir inability to learn from multi-domain sources simultaneously using\ntraditional supervised learning. In this paper, We propose a dynamically\ngrowing tree of sub-networks (DGT) to learn effectively from multi-domain\nsources. DGT uses a novel lifelong learning technique that allows the model to\ncontinuously and effectively learn from new domains without forgetting the\npreviously learned domains. Hence, the model can generalize to out-of-domain\nvideos. The proposed work is evaluated using single-source in-domain\n(traditional video object segmentation), multi-source in-domain, and\nmulti-source out-of-domain video object segmentation. The results of DGT show a\nsingle source in-domain performance gain of 0.2% and 3.5% on the DAVIS16 and\nDAVIS17 datasets, respectively. However, when DGT is evaluated using in-domain\nmulti-sources, the results show superior performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art video object segmentation and other lifelong learning\ntechniques with an average performance increase in the F-score of 6.9% with\nminimal catastrophic forgetting. Finally, in the out-of-domain experiment, the\nperformance of DGT is 2.7% and 4% better than state-of-the-art in 1 and\n5-shots, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The exposure of security vulnerabilities in safety-aligned language models,\ne.g., susceptibility to adversarial attacks, has shed light on the intricate\ninterplay between AI safety and AI security. Although the two disciplines now\ncome together under the overarching goal of AI risk management, they have\nhistorically evolved separately, giving rise to differing perspectives.\nTherefore, in this paper, we advocate that stakeholders in AI risk management\nshould be aware of the nuances, synergies, and interplay between safety and\nsecurity, and unambiguously take into account the perspectives of both\ndisciplines in order to devise mostly effective and holistic risk mitigation\napproaches. Unfortunately, this vision is often obfuscated, as the definitions\nof the basic concepts of \"safety\" and \"security\" themselves are often\ninconsistent and lack consensus across communities. With AI risk management\nbeing increasingly cross-disciplinary, this issue is particularly salient. In\nlight of this conceptual challenge, we introduce a unified reference framework\nto clarify the differences and interplay between AI safety and AI security,\naiming to facilitate a shared understanding and effective collaboration across\ncommunities.",

It extends the work of Arcomano et al.\n(2022), which tested the approach for short- and medium-range weather\nprediction, and the work of Arcomano et al. (2023), which investigated its\npotential for climate modeling. The hybrid model used for the forecast\nexperiments of the paper is based on the low-resolution, simplified\nparameterization atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) SPEEDY. In\naddition to the hybridized prognostic variables of SPEEDY, the current version\nof the model has three purely ML-based prognostic variables. One of these is\n6~h cumulative precipitation, another is the sea surface temperature, while the\nthird is the heat content of the top 300 m deep layer of the ocean. The model\nhas skill in predicting the El Ni\\~no cycle and its global teleconnections with\nprecipitation for 3-7 months depending on the season. The model captures\nequatorial variability of the precipitation associated with Kelvin and Rossby\nwaves and MJO. Predictions of the precipitation in the equatorial region have\nskill for 15 days in the East Pacific and 11.5 days in the West Pacific.

These models produce a single embedding\n$x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ per data-point, allowing for fast retrieval via highly\noptimized maximum inner product search (MIPS) algorithms. Recently, beginning\nwith the landmark ColBERT paper, multi-vector models, which produce a set of\nembedding per data point, have achieved markedly superior performance for IR\ntasks. Unfortunately, using these models for IR is computationally expensive\ndue to the increased complexity of multi-vector retrieval and scoring.\n  In this paper, we introduce MUVERA (MUlti-VEctor Retrieval Algorithm), a\nretrieval mechanism which reduces multi-vector similarity search to\nsingle-vector similarity search. This enables the usage of off-the-shelf MIPS\nsolvers for multi-vector retrieval. MUVERA asymmetrically generates Fixed\nDimensional Encodings (FDEs) of queries and documents, which are vectors whose\ninner product approximates multi-vector similarity. We prove that FDEs give\nhigh-quality $\\epsilon$-approximations, thus providing the first single-vector\nproxy for multi-vector similarity with theoretical guarantees. Empirically, we\nfind that FDEs achieve the same recall as prior state-of-the-art heuristics\nwhile retrieving 2-5$\\times$ fewer candidates. Compared to prior state of the\nart implementations, MUVERA achieves consistently good end-to-end recall and\nlatency across a diverse set of the BEIR retrieval datasets, achieving an\naverage of 10$\\%$ improved recall with $90\\%$ lower latency.",

The framework adopts an encoder-decoder\nstructure, with the encoder utilizing a Swin transformer to efficiently embed\nmost important features. This process involves a Transfer Learning method,\nwherein layers from the Vision Transformer are converted by the Encoder\nTransformer and seamlessly integrated into a CNN Decoder. This methodology\nensures minimal information loss from the original input image. The decoder\nemploys a multi-decoding technique, utilizing dual decoders to generate two\ndistinct attention maps. These maps are subsequently combined into a singular\noutput via an additional CNN model. Our trained model MDS-ViTNet achieves\nstate-of-the-art results across several benchmarks. Committed to fostering\nfurther collaboration, we intend to make our code, models, and datasets\naccessible to the public.",

The core\npremise of this framework is that adaptation is crucial to both biological and\nartificial intelligence and can be understood through operant conditioning\nprinciples. The study assesses this approach via three operant learning tasks\nusing OpenNARS for Applications (ONA): simple discrimination, changing\ncontingencies, and conditional discrimination tasks.\n  In the simple discrimination task, NARS demonstrated rapid learning,\nachieving perfect accuracy during both training and testing phases. The\nchanging contingencies task showcased NARS's adaptability, as it successfully\nadjusted its behavior when task conditions were reversed. In the conditional\ndiscrimination task, NARS handled complex learning scenarios effectively,\nachieving high accuracy by forming and utilizing intricate hypotheses based on\nconditional cues.\n  These findings support the application of operant conditioning as a framework\nfor creating adaptive AGI systems. NARS's ability to operate under conditions\nof insufficient knowledge and resources, coupled with its sensorimotor\nreasoning capabilities, establishes it as a robust model for AGI. The Machine\nPsychology framework, by incorporating elements of natural intelligence such as\ncontinuous learning and goal-driven behavior, offers a scalable and flexible\napproach for real-world applications. Future research should investigate using\nenhanced NARS systems, more advanced tasks, and applying this framework to\ndiverse, complex challenges to further progress the development of human-level\nAI.",

The study utilizes our open source Java\nimplementation that was introduced originally for Java 11 at a time when the\nJava API only provided the much slower polar method. Our Java implementation of\nthe ziggurat algorithm is a port of the GNU Scientific Library's C\nimplementation. Java 17 introduced a significant overhaul of pseudorandom\nnumber generation, including several modern pseudorandom number generators\n(PRNGs) as well as additional functionality, among which includes switching\nfrom the polar method to a modified ziggurat algorithm. In the experiments of\nthis paper, we explore whether there is still a need for our implementation for\nJava 17+ applications. Our results show that Java 17's modified ziggurat is\nfaster than our implementation for the PRNGs that support it. However, Java 17+\ncontinues to use the polar method for the legacy PRNGs Random, SecureRandom,\nand ThreadLocalRandom. The linear congruential method of Java's Random class\nlacks the statistical properties required by Java's modified ziggurat\nimplementation; and SecureRandom and ThreadLocalRandom unfortunately use the\npolar method as a side-effect of extending Random. Our implementation of the\noriginal ziggurat algorithm does not require the same statistical properties of\nthe underlying PRNG as Java 17's optimized version, and can be used with any of\nthese PRNGs, and is especially relevant where pre-Java 17 support is required.",

We\ntrained an nnU-Net segmentation algorithm on this dataset and calculated Dice\nsimilarity coefficients (Dice) to evaluate the model's performance.\n  Results: The model showed a Dice score of 0.824 (CI: 0.801, 0.842) on the\ntest set, which included a wide range of clinical data with major pathologies.\nThe model significantly outperformed two other publicly available segmentation\nmodels (Dice score, 0.824 versus 0.762; p<0.001 and 0.762 versus 0.542;\np<0.001).

Alongside\nthese opportunities is the risk that these systems reify existing power\nimbalances and cause disproportionate harm to marginalized communities.\nParticipatory approaches hold promise to instead lend agency and\ndecision-making power to marginalized stakeholders. But existing approaches in\nparticipatory AI/ML are typically deeply grounded in context - how do we apply\nthese approaches to foundation models, which are, by design, disconnected from\ncontext? Our paper interrogates this question.\n  First, we examine existing attempts at incorporating participation into\nfoundation models. We highlight the tension between participation and scale,\ndemonstrating that it is intractable for impacted communities to meaningfully\nshape a foundation model that is intended to be universally applicable. In\nresponse, we develop a blueprint for participatory foundation models that\nidentifies more local, application-oriented opportunities for meaningful\nparticipation. In addition to the \"foundation\" layer, our framework proposes\nthe \"subfloor'' layer, in which stakeholders develop shared technical\ninfrastructure, norms and governance for a grounded domain, and the \"surface''\nlayer, in which affected communities shape the use of a foundation model for a\nspecific downstream task.

        "abstract": "The principle of data minimization aims to reduce the amount of data\ncollected, processed or retained to minimize the potential for misuse,\nunauthorized access, or data breaches. Rooted in privacy-by-design principles,\ndata minimization has been endorsed by various global data protection\nregulations. However, its practical implementation remains a challenge due to\nthe lack of a rigorous formulation. This paper addresses this gap and\nintroduces an optimization framework for data minimization based on its legal\ndefinitions. It then adapts several optimization algorithms to perform data\nminimization and conducts a comprehensive evaluation in terms of their\ncompliance with minimization objectives as well as their impact on user\nprivacy. Our analysis underscores the mismatch between the privacy expectations\nof data minimization and the actual privacy benefits, emphasizing the need for\napproaches that account for multiple facets of real-world privacy risks.",

We propose a new framework for\nlearning bandit algorithms from massive historical data, which we demonstrate\nin a cold-start recommendation problem. First, we use historical data to\npretrain an autoregressive model to predict a sequence of repeated\nfeedback/rewards (e.g., responses to news articles shown to different users\nover time). In learning to make accurate predictions, the model implicitly\nlearns an informed prior based on rich action features (e.g., article\nheadlines) and how to sharpen beliefs as more rewards are gathered (e.g.,\nclicks as each article is recommended). At decision-time, we autoregressively\nsample (impute) an imagined sequence of rewards for each action, and choose the\naction with the largest average imputed reward. Far from a heuristic, our\napproach is an implementation of Thompson sampling (with a learned prior), a\nprominent active exploration algorithm. We prove our pretraining loss directly\ncontrols online decision-making performance, and we demonstrate our framework\non a news recommendation task where we integrate end-to-end fine-tuning of a\npretrained language model to process news article headline text to improve\nperformance.",

To date, most state-of-the-art TVR methods learn\nimage-to-video transfer learning based on large-scale pre-trained\nvisionlanguage models (e.g., CLIP). However, fully fine-tuning these\npre-trained models for TVR incurs prohibitively expensive computation costs. To\nthis end, we propose to conduct efficient text-video Retrieval with a\nsparse-andcorrelated AdaPter (RAP), i.e., fine-tuning the pre-trained model\nwith a few parameterized layers. To accommodate the text-video scenario, we\nequip our RAP with two indispensable characteristics: temporal sparsity and\ncorrelation. Specifically, we propose a low-rank modulation module to refine\nthe per-image features from the frozen CLIP backbone, which accentuates salient\nframes within the video features while alleviating temporal redundancy.\nBesides, we introduce an asynchronous self-attention mechanism that first\nselects the top responsive visual patches and augments the correlation modeling\nbetween them with learnable temporal and patch offsets. Extensive experiments\non four TVR datasets demonstrate that RAP achieves superior or comparable\nperformance compared to the fully fine-tuned counterpart and other\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion models show a remarkable ability in generating images that closely\nmirror the training distribution. However, these models are prone to training\ndata memorization, leading to significant privacy, ethical, and legal concerns,\nparticularly in sensitive fields such as medical imaging. We hypothesize that\nmemorization is driven by the overparameterization of deep models, suggesting\nthat regularizing model capacity during fine-tuning could be an effective\nmitigation strategy. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer a\npromising approach to capacity control by selectively updating specific\nparameters. However, finding the optimal subset of learnable parameters that\nbalances generation quality and memorization remains elusive. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a bi-level optimization framework that guides automated\nparameter selection by utilizing memorization and generation quality metrics as\nrewards. Our framework successfully identifies the optimal parameter set to be\nupdated to satisfy the generation-memorization tradeoff. We perform our\nexperiments for the specific task of medical image generation and outperform\nexisting state-of-the-art training-time mitigation strategies by fine-tuning as\nfew as 0.019% of model parameters. Furthermore, we show that the strategies\nlearned through our framework are transferable across different datasets and\ndomains. Our proposed framework is scalable to large datasets and agnostic to\nthe choice of reward functions. Finally, we show that our framework can be\ncombined with existing approaches for further memorization mitigation.",

While this problem has been solved in crash-prone systems,\nit has received less attention in Byzantine systems. Recently, Hu and Toueg\ngave such an implementation of the SWMR register from SWSR registers. While\ntheir definition of register linearizability is consistent with the definition\nof Byzantine linearizability of a concurrent history of Cohen and Keidar, it\nhas these drawbacks. (1) If the writer is Byzantine, the register is\nlinearizable no matter what values the correct readers return. (2) It ignores\nvalues written consistently by a Byzantine writer. We need a stronger notion of\na {\\em correct write operation}. (3) It allows a value written to just one or a\nfew readers' SWSR registers to be returned, thereby not validating the\nintention of the writer to write that value honestly. (4) Its notion of a\n``current'' value returned by a correct reader is not related to the most\nrecent value written by a correct write operation of a Byzantine writer. We\nneed a more up to date version of the value that can be returned by a correct\nreader. In this paper, we give a stronger definition of a Byzantine\nlinearizable register that overcomes the above drawbacks. Then we give a\nconstruction of a Byzantine linearizable SWMR atomic register from SWSR\nregisters that meets our stronger definition. The construction is correct when\n$n>3f$, where $n$ is the number of readers, $f$ is the maximum number of\nByzantine readers, and the writer can also be Byzantine.

Grokking\nrefers to a sharp rise of the network's generalization accuracy on the test\nset, which occurs long after an extended overfitting phase, during which the\nnetwork perfectly fits the training set. While the existing research primarily\nfocus on shallow networks such as 2-layer MLP and 1-layer Transformer, we\nexplore grokking on deep networks (e.g. 12-layer MLP). We empirically replicate\nthe phenomenon and find that deep neural networks can be more susceptible to\ngrokking than its shallower counterparts. Meanwhile, we observe an intriguing\nmulti-stage generalization phenomenon when increase the depth of the MLP model\nwhere the test accuracy exhibits a secondary surge, which is scarcely seen on\nshallow models. We further uncover compelling correspondences between the\ndecreasing of feature ranks and the phase transition from overfitting to the\ngeneralization stage during grokking. Additionally, we find that the\nmulti-stage generalization phenomenon often aligns with a double-descent\npattern in feature ranks. These observations suggest that internal feature rank\ncould serve as a more promising indicator of the model's generalization\nbehavior compared to the weight-norm. We believe our work is the first one to\ndive into grokking in deep neural networks, and investigate the relationship of\nfeature rank and generalization performance.",

In contrast, in this work we demonstrate the feasibility of learning a\nsingle, unified representation for quadruped locomotion enabling continuous\nblending between gait types and characteristics. We present Gaitor, which\nlearns a disentangled representation of locomotion skills, thereby sharing\ninformation common to all gait types seen during training. The structure\nemerging in the learnt representation is interpretable in that it is found to\nencode phase correlations between the different gait types. These can be\nleveraged to produce continuous gait transitions. In addition, foot swing\ncharacteristics are disentangled and directly addressable. Together with a\nrudimentary terrain encoding and a learned planner operating in this structured\nlatent representation, Gaitor is able to take motion commands including desired\ngait type and characteristics from a user while reacting to uneven terrain.

        "abstract": "Image deraining aims to remove rain streaks from rainy images and restore\nclear backgrounds. Currently, some research that employs the Fourier transform\nhas proved to be effective for image deraining, due to it acting as an\neffective frequency prior for capturing rain streaks. However, despite there\nexists dependency of low frequency and high frequency in images, these\nFourier-based methods rarely exploit the correlation of different frequencies\nfor conjuncting their learning procedures, limiting the full utilization of\nfrequency information for image deraining. Alternatively, the recently emerged\nMamba technique depicts its effectiveness and efficiency for modeling\ncorrelation in various domains (e.g., spatial, temporal), and we argue that\nintroducing Mamba into its unexplored Fourier spaces to correlate different\nfrequencies would help improve image deraining. This motivates us to propose a\nnew framework termed FourierMamba, which performs image deraining with Mamba in\nthe Fourier space. Owning to the unique arrangement of frequency orders in\nFourier space, the core of FourierMamba lies in the scanning encoding of\ndifferent frequencies, where the low-high frequency order formats exhibit\ndifferently in the spatial dimension (unarranged in axis) and channel dimension\n(arranged in axis). Therefore, we design FourierMamba that correlates Fourier\nspace information in the spatial and channel dimensions with distinct designs.\nSpecifically, in the spatial dimension Fourier space, we introduce the zigzag\ncoding to scan the frequencies to rearrange the orders from low to high\nfrequencies, thereby orderly correlating the connections between frequencies;\nin the channel dimension Fourier space with arranged orders of frequencies in\naxis, we can directly use Mamba to perform frequency correlation and improve\nthe channel information representation.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in\nmathematical problem solving, particularly in single turn question answering\nformats. However, real world scenarios often involve mathematical question\nanswering that requires multi turn or interactive information exchanges, and\nthe performance of LLMs on these tasks is still underexplored. This paper\nintroduces MathChat, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to\nevaluate LLMs across a broader spectrum of mathematical tasks. These tasks are\nstructured to assess the models' abilities in multiturn interactions and open\nended generation. We evaluate the performance of various SOTA LLMs on the\nMathChat benchmark, and we observe that while these models excel in single turn\nquestion answering, they significantly underperform in more complex scenarios\nthat require sustained reasoning and dialogue understanding. To address the\nabove limitations of existing LLMs when faced with multiturn and open ended\ntasks, we develop MathChat sync, a synthetic dialogue based math dataset for\nLLM finetuning, focusing on improving models' interaction and instruction\nfollowing capabilities in conversations. Experimental results emphasize the\nneed for training LLMs with diverse, conversational instruction tuning datasets\nlike MathChatsync. We believe this work outlines one promising direction for\nimproving the multiturn mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs, thus pushing\nforward the development of LLMs that are more adept at interactive mathematical\nproblem solving and real world applications.",

Recent works provide some effective\nalgorithms with theoretical analysis but they are limited by the standard\n$L$-smooth or bounded-gradient assumptions, which are typically unsatisfactory\nfor neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers.\nIn this paper, we study a more general and realistic class of $\\ell$-smooth\nloss functions, where $\\ell$ is a general non-decreasing function of gradient\nnorm. We develop two novel single-loop algorithms for $\\ell$-smooth MOO\nproblems, Generalized Smooth Multi-objective Gradient descent (GSMGrad) and its\nstochastic variant, Stochastic Generalized Smooth Multi-objective Gradient\ndescent (SGSMGrad), which approximate the conflict-avoidant (CA) direction that\nmaximizes the minimum improvement among objectives.

While previous attempts have\ntargeted deep policy networks, DP used diffusion models as the policy network,\nmaking it ineffective to be attacked using previous methods because of its\nchained structure and randomness injected.

        "abstract": "Thermal cameras are an important tool for agricultural research because they\nallow for non-invasive measurement of plant temperature, which relates to\nimportant photochemical, hydraulic, and agronomic traits. Utilizing low-cost\nthermal cameras can lower the barrier to introducing thermal imaging in\nagricultural research and production. This paper presents an approach to\nimprove the temperature accuracy and image quality of low-cost thermal imaging\ncameras for agricultural applications. Leveraging advancements in computer\nvision techniques, particularly deep learning networks, we propose a method,\ncalled $\\textbf{VisTA-SR}$ ($\\textbf{Vis}$ual \\& $\\textbf{T}$hermal\n$\\textbf{A}$lignment and $\\textbf{S}$uper-$\\textbf{R}$esolution Enhancement)\nthat combines RGB and thermal images to enhance the capabilities of\nlow-resolution thermal cameras. The research includes calibration and\nvalidation of temperature measurements, acquisition of paired image datasets,\nand the development of a deep learning network tailored for agricultural\nthermal imaging. Our study addresses the challenges of image enhancement in the\nagricultural domain and explores the potential of low-cost thermal cameras to\nreplace high-resolution industrial cameras. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach in enhancing temperature accuracy and image\nsharpness, paving the way for more accessible and efficient thermal imaging\nsolutions in agriculture.",

        "abstract": "The two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is a fundamental model, which is\ndrawing increasing interest because of recent advances in experimental and\ntheoretical studies of 2D materials. Current understanding of the ground state\nof the 2DEG relies on quantum Monte Carlo calculations, based on variational\ncomparisons of different ansatze for different phases. We use a single\nvariational ansatz, a general backflow-type wave function using a\nmessage-passing neural quantum state architecture, for a unified description\nacross the entire density range. The variational optimization consistently\nleads to lower ground-state energies than previous best results. Transition\ninto a Wigner crystal (WC) phase occurs automatically at rs = 37 +/- 1, a\ndensity lower than currently believed. Between the liquid and WC phases, the\nsame ansatz and variational search strongly suggest the existence of\nintermediate states in a broad range of densities, with enhanced short-range\nnematic spin correlations.",

        "abstract": "Preference optimization, particularly through Reinforcement Learning from\nHuman Feedback (RLHF), has achieved significant success in aligning Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to adhere to human intentions. Unlike offline alignment\nwith a fixed dataset, online feedback collection from humans or AI on model\ngenerations typically leads to more capable reward models and better-aligned\nLLMs through an iterative process. However, achieving a globally accurate\nreward model requires systematic exploration to generate diverse responses that\nspan the vast space of natural language. Random sampling from standard\nreward-maximizing LLMs alone is insufficient to fulfill this requirement. To\naddress this issue, we propose a bilevel objective optimistically biased\ntowards potentially high-reward responses to actively explore\nout-of-distribution regions. By solving the inner-level problem with the\nreparameterized reward function, the resulting algorithm, named Self-Exploring\nLanguage Models (SELM), eliminates the need for a separate RM and iteratively\nupdates the LLM with a straightforward objective. Compared to Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO), the SELM objective reduces indiscriminate favor of unseen\nextrapolations and enhances exploration efficiency. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that when finetuned on Zephyr-7B-SFT and Llama-3-8B-Instruct\nmodels, SELM significantly boosts the performance on instruction-following\nbenchmarks such as MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.0, as well as various standard\nacademic benchmarks in different settings.

        "abstract": "The creation of high-fidelity, digital versions of human heads is an\nimportant stepping stone in the process of further integrating virtual\ncomponents into our everyday lives. Constructing such avatars is a challenging\nresearch problem, due to a high demand for photo-realism and real-time\nrendering performance. In this work, we propose Neural Parametric Gaussian\nAvatars (NPGA), a data-driven approach to create high-fidelity, controllable\navatars from multi-view video recordings. We build our method around 3D\nGaussian Splatting for its highly efficient rendering and to inherit the\ntopological flexibility of point clouds. In contrast to previous work, we\ncondition our avatars' dynamics on the rich expression space of neural\nparametric head models (NPHM), instead of mesh-based 3DMMs. To this end, we\ndistill the backward deformation field of our underlying NPHM into forward\ndeformations which are compatible with rasterization-based rendering. All\nremaining fine-scale, expression-dependent details are learned from the\nmulti-view videos. To increase the representational capacity of our avatars, we\naugment the canonical Gaussian point cloud using per-primitive latent features\nwhich govern its dynamic behavior. To regularize this increased dynamic\nexpressivity, we propose Laplacian terms on the latent features and predicted\ndynamics. We evaluate our method on the public NeRSemble dataset, demonstrating\nthat NPGA significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art avatars on\nthe self-reenactment task by 2.6 PSNR.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19328v1",
        "abstract": "Generative agents, which implement behaviors using a large language model\n(LLM) to interpret and evaluate an environment, has demonstrated the capacity\nto solve complex tasks across many social and technological domains. However,\nwhen these agents interact with other agents and humans in presence of social\nstructures such as existing norms, fostering cooperation between them is a\nfundamental challenge. In this paper, we develop the framework of a 'Normative\nModule': an architecture designed to enhance cooperation by enabling agents to\nrecognize and adapt to the normative infrastructure of a given environment. We\nfocus on the equilibrium selection aspect of the cooperation problem and inform\nour agent design based on the existence of classification institutions that\nimplement correlated equilibrium to provide effective resolution of the\nequilibrium selection problem. Specifically, the normative module enables\nagents to learn through peer interactions which of multiple candidate\ninstitutions in the environment, does a group treat as authoritative. By\nenabling normative competence in this sense, agents gain ability to coordinate\ntheir sanctioning behaviour; coordinated sanctioning behaviour in turn shapes\nprimary behaviour within a social environment, leading to higher average\nwelfare. We design a new environment that supports institutions and evaluate\nthe proposed framework based on two key criteria derived from agent\ninteractions with peers and institutions: (i) the agent's ability to disregard\nnon-authoritative institutions and (ii) the agent's ability to identify\nauthoritative institutions among several options. We show that these\ncapabilities allow the agent to achieve more stable cooperative outcomes\ncompared to baseline agents without the normative module, paving the way for\nresearch in a new avenue of designing environments and agents that account for\nnormative infrastructure.",

However, due to\ncommercial interest, the most competitive models like GPT, Gemini, and Claude\nhave been gated behind proprietary interfaces without disclosing the training\ndetails. Recently, many institutions have open-sourced several strong LLMs like\nLLaMA-3, comparable to existing closed-source LLMs. However, only the model's\nweights are provided with most details (e.g., intermediate checkpoints,\npre-training corpus, and training code, etc.) being undisclosed. To improve the\ntransparency of LLMs, the research community has formed to open-source truly\nopen LLMs (e.g., Pythia, Amber, OLMo), where more details (e.g., pre-training\ncorpus and training code) are being provided. These models have greatly\nadvanced the scientific study of these large models including their strengths,\nweaknesses, biases and risks. However, we observe that the existing truly open\nLLMs on reasoning, knowledge, and coding tasks are still inferior to existing\nstate-of-the-art LLMs with similar model sizes. To this end, we open-source\nMAP-Neo, a highly capable and transparent bilingual language model with 7B\nparameters trained from scratch on 4.5T high-quality tokens.

Experimentation reveals that our approach is generalizable\nand can effectively localize and highlight parts of 3D objects (in 3D mesh)\nbased on implicit textual queries, including these articulated 3d objects and\nreal-world scanned data. Our method can also generate natural language\nexplanations corresponding to these 3D models and the decomposition. Moreover,\nour training-free approach allows rapid deployment and serves as a viable\nuniversal baseline for future research of part-level 3d (semantic) object\nunderstanding in various fields including robotics, object manipulation, part\nassembly, autonomous driving applications, augment reality and virtual reality\n(AR/VR), and medical applications.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often hallucinate and lack the ability to\nprovide attribution for their generations. Semi-parametric LMs, such as kNN-LM,\napproach these limitations by refining the output of an LM for a given prompt\nusing its nearest neighbor matches in a non-parametric data store. However,\nthese models often exhibit slow inference speeds and produce non-fluent texts.\nIn this paper, we introduce Nearest Neighbor Speculative Decoding (NEST), a\nnovel semi-parametric language modeling approach that is capable of\nincorporating real-world text spans of arbitrary length into the LM generations\nand providing attribution to their sources. NEST performs token-level retrieval\nat each inference step to compute a semi-parametric mixture distribution and\nidentify promising span continuations in a corpus. It then uses an approximate\nspeculative decoding procedure that accepts a prefix of the retrieved span or\ngenerates a new token. NEST significantly enhances the generation quality and\nattribution rate of the base LM across a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks,\nsurpassing the conventional kNN-LM method and performing competitively with\nin-context retrieval augmentation. In addition, NEST substantially improves the\ngeneration speed, achieving a 1.8x speedup in inference time when applied to\nLlama-2-Chat 70B.",

A key bottleneck is understanding how to\nincorporate uncertainty estimation in the reward function learned from the\npreference data for RLHF, regardless of how the preference data is collected.\nWhile the principles of optimism or pessimism under uncertainty are\nwell-established in standard reinforcement learning (RL), a\npractically-implementable and theoretically-grounded form amenable to large\nlanguage models is not yet available, as standard techniques for constructing\nconfidence intervals become intractable under arbitrary policy\nparameterizations.\n  In this paper, we introduce a unified approach to online and offline RLHF --\nvalue-incentivized preference optimization (VPO) -- which regularizes the\nmaximum-likelihood estimate of the reward function with the corresponding value\nfunction, modulated by a $\\textit{sign}$ to indicate whether the optimism or\npessimism is chosen. VPO also directly optimizes the policy with implicit\nreward modeling, and therefore shares a simpler RLHF pipeline similar to direct\npreference optimization.

        "abstract": "Language model (LM) post-training (or alignment) involves maximizing a reward\nfunction that is derived from preference annotations. Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) is a popular offline alignment method that trains a policy\ndirectly on preference data without the need to train a reward model or apply\nreinforcement learning. However, typical preference datasets have only a\nsingle, or at most a few, annotation per preference pair, which causes DPO to\noverconfidently assign rewards that trend towards infinite magnitude. This\nfrequently leads to degenerate policies, sometimes causing even the\nprobabilities of the preferred generations to go to zero. In this work, we\nanalyze this phenomenon and propose distillation to get a better proxy for the\ntrue preference distribution over generation pairs: we train the LM to produce\nprobabilities that match the distribution induced by a reward model trained on\nthe preference data. Moreover, to account for uncertainty in the reward model\nwe are distilling from, we optimize against a family of reward models that, as\na whole, is likely to include at least one reasonable proxy for the preference\ndistribution. Our results show that distilling from such a family of reward\nmodels leads to improved robustness to distribution shift in preference\nannotations, while preserving the simple supervised nature of DPO.",

        "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically encode an image into a fixed\nnumber of visual tokens (e.g., 576) and process these tokens with a language\nmodel. Despite their strong performance, LVLMs face challenges in adapting to\nvarying computational constraints. This raises the question: can we achieve\nflexibility in the number of visual tokens to suit different tasks and\ncomputational resources? We answer this with an emphatic yes. Inspired by\nMatryoshka Representation Learning, we introduce the Matryoshka Query\nTransformer (MQT), capable of encoding an image into m visual tokens during\ninference, where m can be any number up to a predefined maximum. This is\nachieved by employing a query transformer with M latent query tokens to\ncompress the visual embeddings. During each training step, we randomly select m\n<= M latent query tokens and train the model using only these first m tokens,\ndiscarding the rest. Combining MQT with LLaVA, we train a single model once,\nand flexibly and drastically reduce the number of inference-time visual tokens\nwhile maintaining similar or better performance compared to training\nindependent models for each number of tokens. Our model, MQT-LLAVA, matches\nLLaVA-1.5 performance across 11 benchmarks using a maximum of 256 tokens\ninstead of LLaVA's fixed 576. Reducing to 16 tokens (8x less TFLOPs) only\nsacrifices the performance by 2.4 points on MMBench. On certain tasks such as\nScienceQA and MMMU, we can even go down to only 2 visual tokens with\nperformance drops of just 3% and 6% each. Our exploration of the trade-off\nbetween the accuracy and computational cost brought about by the number of\nvisual tokens facilitates future research to achieve the best of both worlds.",

        "abstract": "The observed similarities in the behavior of humans and Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have prompted researchers to consider the potential of using LLMs as\nmodels of human cognition. However, several significant challenges must be\naddressed before LLMs can be legitimately regarded as cognitive models. For\ninstance, LLMs are trained on far more data than humans typically encounter,\nand may have been directly trained on human data in specific cognitive tasks or\naligned with human preferences. Consequently, the origins of these behavioral\nsimilarities are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a novel way to\nenhance the utility of LLMs as cognitive models. This approach involves (i)\nleveraging computationally equivalent tasks that both an LLM and a rational\nagent need to master for solving a cognitive problem and (ii) examining the\nspecific task distributions required for an LLM to exhibit human-like\nbehaviors. We apply this approach to decision-making -- specifically risky and\nintertemporal choice -- where the key computationally equivalent task is the\narithmetic of expected value calculations. We show that an LLM pretrained on an\necologically valid arithmetic dataset, which we call Arithmetic-GPT, predicts\nhuman behavior better than many traditional cognitive models. Pretraining LLMs\non ecologically valid arithmetic datasets is sufficient to produce a strong\ncorrespondence between these models and human decision-making. Our results also\nsuggest that LLMs used as cognitive models should be carefully investigated via\nablation studies of the pretraining data.",

The source keeps\nupdates of a process, that might be generated or observed, and shares them with\nthe gossiping network. The nodes in the network communicate with their\nneighbors and disseminate these version updates using a push-style gossip\nstrategy. We use the version age metric to quantify the timeliness of\ninformation at the nodes. We first find an upper bound for the average version\nage for a set of nodes in a general network. Using this, we find the average\nversion age scaling of a node in several network graph structures, such as\ntwo-dimensional grids, generalized rings and hyper-cubes. Prior to our work, it\nwas known that when $n$ nodes are connected on a ring the version age scales as\n$O(n^{\\frac{1}{2}})$, and when they are connected on a fully-connected graph\nthe version age scales as $O(\\log n)$. Ours is the first work to show an age\nscaling result for a connectivity structure other than the ring and the\nfully-connected network, which constitute the two extremes of network\nconnectivity. Our work helps fill the gap between these two extremes by\nanalyzing a large variety of graphs with intermediate connectivity, thus\nproviding insight into the relationship between the connectivity structure of\nthe network and the version age, and uncovering a network\nconnectivity--information freshness tradeoff.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by the recital (67) of the current corrigendum of the AI Act in the\nEuropean Union, we propose and present measures and mitigation strategies for\ndiscrimination in tabular datasets. We specifically focus on datasets that\ncontain multiple protected attributes, such as nationality, age, and sex. This\nmakes measuring and mitigating bias more challenging, as many existing methods\nare designed for a single protected attribute. This paper comes with a twofold\ncontribution: Firstly, new discrimination measures are introduced. These\nmeasures are categorized in our framework along with existing ones, guiding\nresearchers and practitioners in choosing the right measure to assess the\nfairness of the underlying dataset. Secondly, a novel application of an\nexisting bias mitigation method, FairDo, is presented. We show that this\nstrategy can mitigate any type of discrimination, including intersectional\ndiscrimination, by transforming the dataset. By conducting experiments on\nreal-world datasets (Adult, Bank, Compas), we demonstrate that de-biasing\ndatasets with multiple protected attributes is achievable. Further, the\ntransformed fair datasets do not compromise any of the tested machine learning\nmodels' performances significantly when trained on these datasets compared to\nthe original datasets. Discrimination was reduced by up to 83% in our\nexperimentation. For most experiments, the disparity between protected groups\nwas reduced by at least 7% and 27% on average. Generally, the findings show\nthat the mitigation strategy used is effective, and this study contributes to\nthe ongoing discussion on the implementation of the European Union's AI Act.",

To address this gap, we introduce Compare2Score-an all-around\nLMM-based no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) model, which is capable of producing\nqualitatively comparative responses and effectively translating these discrete\ncomparative levels into a continuous quality score. Specifically, during\ntraining, we present to generate scaled-up comparative instructions by\ncomparing images from the same IQA dataset, allowing for more flexible\nintegration of diverse IQA datasets. Utilizing the established large-scale\ntraining corpus, we develop a human-like visual quality comparator. During\ninference, moving beyond binary choices, we propose a soft comparison method\nthat calculates the likelihood of the test image being preferred over multiple\npredefined anchor images. The quality score is further optimized by maximum a\nposteriori estimation with the resulting probability matrix. Extensive\nexperiments on nine IQA datasets validate that the Compare2Score effectively\nbridges text-defined comparative levels during training with converted single\nimage quality score for inference, surpassing state-of-the-art IQA models\nacross diverse scenarios.

First, a vocabulary cannot be modified once it is\nlearned, making it hard to adapt to new words. Second, in multilingual\ntranslation, the imbalance in data volumes across different languages spreads\nto the vocabulary, exacerbating translations involving low-resource languages.\nWhile byte-based tokenization addresses these issues, byte-based models\nstruggle with the low information density inherent in UTF-8 byte sequences.\nPrevious works enhance token semantics through local contextualization but fail\nto select an appropriate contextualizing scope based on the input.\nConsequently, we propose the Multi-Scale Contextualization (MSC) method, which\nlearns contextualized information of varying scales across different hidden\nstate dimensions.

In response to the complexity of practical\nmotion control, we propose and attempt to solve the open-set motion control\nproblem. This problem is characterized by an open and fully customizable set of\nmotion control tasks. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm,\nprogrammable motion generation. In this paradigm, any given motion control task\nis broken down into a combination of atomic constraints. These constraints are\nthen programmed into an error function that quantifies the degree to which a\nmotion sequence adheres to them. We utilize a pre-trained motion generation\nmodel and optimize its latent code to minimize the error function of the\ngenerated motion. Consequently, the generated motion not only inherits the\nprior of the generative model but also satisfies the required constraints.\nExperiments show that we can generate high-quality motions when addressing a\nwide range of unseen tasks. These tasks encompass motion control by motion\ndynamics, geometric constraints, physical laws, interactions with scenes,\nobjects or the character own body parts, etc. All of these are achieved in a\nunified approach, without the need for ad-hoc paired training data collection\nor specialized network designs.

Machine learning\nmethods are promising in significantly accelerating charge density prediction,\nyet existing approaches either lack accuracy or scalability. We propose a\nrecipe that can achieve both. In particular, we identify three key ingredients:\n(1) representing the charge density with atomic and virtual orbitals (spherical\nfields centered at atom/virtual coordinates); (2) using expressive and\nlearnable orbital basis sets (basis function for the spherical fields); and (3)\nusing high-capacity equivariant neural network architecture. Our method\nachieves state-of-the-art accuracy while being more than an order of magnitude\nfaster than existing methods. Furthermore, our method enables flexible\nefficiency-accuracy trade-offs by adjusting the model/basis sizes.",

        "abstract": "This report explores the potential implications of rapidly integrating\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) applications into children's environments. The\nintroduction of AI in our daily lives necessitates scrutiny considering the\nsignificant role of the environment in shaping cognition, socio-emotional\nskills, and behaviors, especially during the first 25 years of cerebral\ndevelopment. As AI becomes prevalent in educational and leisure activities, it\nwill significantly modify the experiences of children and adolescents,\npresenting both challenges and opportunities for their developmental\ntrajectories. This analysis was informed by consulting with 15 experts from\npertinent disciplines (AI, product development, child development, and\nneurosciences), along with a comprehensive review of scientific literature on\nchildren development and child-technology interactions. Overall, AI experts\nanticipate that AI will transform leisure activities, revolutionize education,\nand redefine human-machine interactions. While AI offers substantial benefits\nin fostering interactive engagement, it also poses risks that require careful\nconsiderations, especially during sensitive developmental periods. The report\nadvocates for proactive international collaboration across multiple disciplines\nand increased research into how technological innovations affect child\ndevelopment. Such efforts are crucial for designing a sustainable and ethical\nfuture for the next generation through specific child-centered regulations, and\nhelping to educate all potential stakeholders (regulators, developers, parents\nand educators, children) about responsible AI use and its potential impacts on\nchild development.",

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning (ML) approach\nthat keeps data localized and often incorporates Differential Privacy (DP) to\nenhance privacy guarantees. Similar to previous work on DP in ML, we observed\nthat differentially private federated learning (DPFL) introduces performance\ndisparities, particularly affecting minority groups. Recent work has attempted\nto address performance fairness in vanilla FL through clustering, but this\nmethod remains sensitive and prone to errors, which are further exacerbated by\nthe DP noise in DPFL. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel\nclustered DPFL algorithm designed to effectively identify clients' clusters in\nhighly heterogeneous settings while maintaining high accuracy with DP\nguarantees. To this end, we propose to cluster clients based on both their\nmodel updates and training loss values. Our proposed approach also addresses\nthe server's uncertainties in clustering clients' model updates by employing\nlarger batch sizes along with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to alleviate the\nimpact of noise and potential clustering errors, especially in\nprivacy-sensitive scenarios. We provide theoretical analysis of the\neffectiveness of our proposed approach. We also extensively evaluate our\napproach across diverse data distributions and privacy budgets and show its\neffectiveness in mitigating the disparate impact of DP in FL settings with a\nsmall computational cost.",

        "abstract": "Developing intelligent pediatric consultation systems offers promising\nprospects for improving diagnostic efficiency, especially in China, where\nhealthcare resources are scarce. Despite recent advances in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) for Chinese medicine, their performance is sub-optimal in\npediatric applications due to inadequate instruction data and vulnerable\ntraining procedures. To address the above issues, this paper builds PedCorpus,\na high-quality dataset of over 300,000 multi-task instructions from pediatric\ntextbooks, guidelines, and knowledge graph resources to fulfil diverse\ndiagnostic demands. Upon well-designed PedCorpus, we propose PediatricsGPT, the\nfirst Chinese pediatric LLM assistant built on a systematic and robust training\npipeline. In the continuous pre-training phase, we introduce a hybrid\ninstruction pre-training mechanism to mitigate the internal-injected knowledge\ninconsistency of LLMs for medical domain adaptation. Immediately, the\nfull-parameter Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is utilized to incorporate the\ngeneral medical knowledge schema into the models. After that, we devise a\ndirect following preference optimization to enhance the generation of\npediatrician-like humanistic responses. In the parameter-efficient secondary\nSFT phase, a mixture of universal-specific experts strategy is presented to\nresolve the competency conflict between medical generalist and pediatric\nexpertise mastery. Extensive results based on the metrics, GPT-4, and doctor\nevaluations on distinct doctor downstream tasks show that PediatricsGPT\nconsistently outperforms previous Chinese medical LLMs. Our model and dataset\nwill be open-source for community development.",

        "abstract": "Cascades and speculative decoding are two common approaches to improving\nlanguage models' inference efficiency. Both approaches involve interleaving\nmodels of different sizes, but via fundamentally distinct mechanisms: cascades\nemploy a deferral rule that invokes the larger model only for \"hard\" inputs,\nwhile speculative decoding uses speculative execution to primarily invoke the\nlarger model in parallel verification mode. These mechanisms offer different\nbenefits: empirically, cascades are often capable of yielding better quality\nthan even the larger model, while theoretically, speculative decoding offers a\nguarantee of quality-neutrality. In this paper, we leverage the best of both\nthese approaches by designing new speculative cascading techniques that\nimplement their deferral rule through speculative execution. We characterize\nthe optimal deferral rule for our speculative cascades, and employ a plug-in\napproximation to the optimal rule.

        "abstract": "The neighbor-based method has become a powerful tool to handle the outlier\ndetection problem, which aims to infer the abnormal degree of the sample based\non the compactness of the sample and its neighbors. However, the existing\nmethods commonly focus on designing different processes to locate outliers in\nthe dataset, while the contributions of different types neighbors to outlier\ndetection has not been well discussed. To this end, this paper studies the\nneighbor in the existing outlier detection algorithms and a taxonomy is\nintroduced, which uses the three-level components of information, neighbor and\nmethodology to define hybrid methods. This taxonomy can serve as a paradigm\nwhere a novel neighbor-based outlier detection method can be proposed by\ncombining different components in this taxonomy. A large number of comparative\nexperiments were conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets in terms of\nperformance comparison and case study, and the results show that reverse\nK-nearest neighbor based methods achieve promising performance and dynamic\nselection method is suitable for working in high-dimensional space. Notably, it\nis verified that rationally selecting components from this taxonomy may create\nan algorithms superior to existing methods.",

        "abstract": "Numerically solving multi-marginal optimal transport (MMOT) problems is\ncomputationally prohibitive, even for moderate-scale instances involving\n$l\\ge4$ marginals with support sizes of $N\\ge1000$. The cost in MMOT is\nrepresented as a tensor with $N^l$ elements. Even accessing each element once\nincurs a significant computational burden. In fact, many algorithms require\ndirect computation of tensor-vector products, leading to a computational\ncomplexity of $O(N^l)$ or beyond. In this paper, inspired by our previous work\n[$Comm. \\ Math. \\ Sci.$, 20 (2022), pp. 2053 - 2057], we observe that the\ncostly tensor-vector products in the Sinkhorn Algorithm can be computed with a\nrecursive process by separating summations and dynamic programming. Based on\nthis idea, we propose a fast tensor-vector product algorithm to solve the MMOT\nproblem with $L^1$ cost, achieving a miraculous reduction in the computational\ncost of the entropy regularized solution to $O(N)$. Numerical experiment\nresults confirm such high performance of this novel method which can be several\norders of magnitude faster than the original Sinkhorn algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In belief revision, agents typically modify their beliefs when they receive\nsome new piece of information that is in conflict with them. The guiding\nprinciple behind most belief revision frameworks is that of minimalism, which\nadvocates minimal changes to existing beliefs. However, minimalism may not\nnecessarily capture the nuanced ways in which human agents reevaluate and\nmodify their beliefs. In contrast, the explanatory hypothesis indicates that\npeople are inherently driven to seek explanations for inconsistencies, thereby\nstriving for explanatory coherence rather than minimal changes when revising\nbeliefs. Our contribution in this paper is two-fold. Motivated by the\nexplanatory hypothesis, we first present a novel, yet simple belief revision\noperator that, given a belief base and an explanation for an explanandum, it\nrevises the belief bases in a manner that preserves the explanandum and is not\nnecessarily minimal. We call this operator explanation-based belief revision.\nSecond, we conduct two human-subject studies to empirically validate our\napproach and investigate belief revision behavior in real-world scenarios. Our\nfindings support the explanatory hypothesis and provide insights into the\nstrategies people employ when resolving inconsistencies.",

Recently, the text-to-image generation community\nhas begun addressing these concerns by editing or unlearning undesired concepts\nfrom pre-trained models.

        "abstract": "In transportation networks, intersections pose significant risks of\ncollisions due to conflicting movements of vehicles approaching from different\ndirections. To address this issue, various tools can exert influence on traffic\nsafety both directly and indirectly. This study focuses on investigating the\nimpact of adaptive signal control and connected and automated vehicles (CAVs)\non intersection safety using a deep reinforcement learning approach. The\nobjective is to assess the individual and combined effects of CAVs and adaptive\ntraffic signal control on traffic safety, considering rear-end and crossing\nconflicts. The study employs a Deep Q Network (DQN) to regulate traffic signals\nand driving behaviors of both CAVs and Human Drive Vehicles (HDVs), and uses\nTime To Collision (TTC) metric to evaluate safety. The findings demonstrate a\nsignificant reduction in rear-end and crossing conflicts through the combined\nimplementation of CAVs and DQNs-based traffic signal control. Additionally, the\nlong-term positive effects of CAVs on safety are similar to the short-term\neffects of combined CAVs and DQNs-based traffic signal control. Overall, the\nstudy emphasizes the potential benefits of integrating CAVs and adaptive\ntraffic signal control approaches in order to enhance traffic safety.

        "abstract": "Unsupervised Continual Learning (UCL) is a burgeoning field in machine\nlearning, focusing on enabling neural networks to sequentially learn tasks\nwithout explicit label information. Catastrophic Forgetting (CF), where models\nforget previously learned tasks upon learning new ones, poses a significant\nchallenge in continual learning, especially in UCL, where labeled information\nof data is not accessible. CF mitigation strategies, such as knowledge\ndistillation and replay buffers, often face memory inefficiency and privacy\nissues. Although current research in UCL has endeavored to refine data\nrepresentations and address CF in streaming data contexts, there is a\nnoticeable lack of algorithms specifically designed for unsupervised\nclustering. To fill this gap, in this paper, we introduce the concept of\nUnsupervised Continual Clustering (UCC). We propose Forward-Backward Knowledge\nDistillation for unsupervised Continual Clustering (FBCC) to counteract CF\nwithin the context of UCC. FBCC employs a single continual learner (the\n``teacher'') with a cluster projector, along with multiple student models, to\naddress the CF issue. The proposed method consists of two phases: Forward\nKnowledge Distillation, where the teacher learns new clusters while retaining\nknowledge from previous tasks with guidance from specialized student models,\nand Backward Knowledge Distillation, where a student model mimics the teacher's\nbehavior to retain task-specific knowledge, aiding the teacher in subsequent\ntasks. FBCC marks a pioneering approach to UCC, demonstrating enhanced\nperformance and memory efficiency in clustering across various tasks,\noutperforming the application of clustering algorithms to the latent space of\nstate-of-the-art UCL algorithms.",

However, generating explanations\nin uncertain environments characterized by incomplete information and\nprobabilistic models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose\na novel framework for generating probabilistic monolithic explanations and\nmodel reconciling explanations. Monolithic explanations provide self-contained\nreasons for an explanandum without considering the agent receiving the\nexplanation, while model reconciling explanations account for the knowledge of\nthe agent receiving the explanation. For monolithic explanations, our approach\nintegrates uncertainty by utilizing probabilistic logic to increase the\nprobability of the explanandum. For model reconciling explanations, we propose\na framework that extends the logic-based variant of the model reconciliation\nproblem to account for probabilistic human models, where the goal is to find\nexplanations that increase the probability of the explanandum while minimizing\nconflicts between the explanation and the probabilistic human model. We\nintroduce explanatory gain and explanatory power as quantitative metrics to\nassess the quality of these explanations. Further, we present algorithms that\nexploit the duality between minimal correction sets and minimal unsatisfiable\nsets to efficiently compute both types of explanations in probabilistic\ncontexts.

        "abstract": "Image retrieval from contextual descriptions (IRCD) aims to identify an image\nwithin a set of minimally contrastive candidates based on linguistically\ncomplex text. Despite the success of VLMs, they still significantly lag behind\nhuman performance in IRCD. The main challenges lie in aligning key contextual\ncues in two modalities, where these subtle cues are concealed in tiny areas of\nmultiple contrastive images and within the complex linguistics of textual\ndescriptions. This motivates us to propose ContextBLIP, a simple yet effective\nmethod that relies on a doubly contextual alignment scheme for challenging\nIRCD. Specifically, 1) our model comprises a multi-scale adapter, a matching\nloss, and a text-guided masking loss. The adapter learns to capture\nfine-grained visual cues. The two losses enable iterative supervision for the\nadapter, gradually highlighting the focal patches of a single image to the key\ntextual cues. We term such a way as intra-contextual alignment. 2) Then,\nContextBLIP further employs an inter-context encoder to learn dependencies\namong candidates, facilitating alignment between the text to multiple images.\nWe term this step as inter-contextual alignment. Consequently, the nuanced cues\nconcealed in each modality can be effectively aligned. Experiments on two\nbenchmarks show the superiority of our method. We observe that ContextBLIP can\nyield comparable results with GPT-4V, despite involving about 7,500 times fewer\nparameters.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning techniques are steadily becoming more important in modern\nbiology, and are used to build predictive models, discover patterns, and\ninvestigate biological problems. However, models trained on one dataset are\noften not generalizable to other datasets from different cohorts or\nlaboratories, due to differences in the statistical properties of these\ndatasets. These could stem from technical differences, such as the measurement\ntechnique used, or from relevant biological differences between the populations\nstudied. Domain adaptation, a type of transfer learning, can alleviate this\nproblem by aligning the statistical distributions of features and samples among\ndifferent datasets so that similar models can be applied across them. However,\na majority of state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods are designed to work\nwith large-scale data, mostly text and images, while biological datasets often\nsuffer from small sample sizes, and possess complexities such as heterogeneity\nof the feature space. This Review aims to synthetically discuss domain\nadaptation methods in the context of small-scale and highly heterogeneous\nbiological data. We describe the benefits and challenges of domain adaptation\nin biological research and critically discuss some of its objectives,\nstrengths, and weaknesses through key representative methodologies. We argue\nfor the incorporation of domain adaptation techniques to the computational\nbiologist's toolkit, with further development of customized approaches.",

In this study, we propose an\narchitecture-agnostic algorithm, Gradient Guided Hypotheses (GGH), designed to\naddress these challenges. GGH analyses gradients from hypotheses as a proxy of\ndistinct and possibly contradictory patterns in the data. This framework\nentails an additional step in machine learning training, where gradients can be\nincluded or excluded from backpropagation. In this manner, missing and noisy\ndata are addressed through a unified solution that perceives both challenges as\nfacets of the same overarching issue: the propagation of erroneous information.\nExperimental validation of GGH is conducted using real-world open-source\ndatasets, where records with missing rates of up to 98.5% are simulated.\nComparative analysis with state-of-the-art imputation methods demonstrates a\nsubstantial improvement in model performance achieved by GGH. Specifically in\nvery high scarcity regimes, GGH was found to be the only viable solution.\nAdditionally, GGH's noise detection capabilities are showcased by introducing\nsimulated noise into the datasets and observing enhanced model performance\nafter filtering out the noisy data.

        "abstract": "Video-language understanding tasks have focused on short video clips, often\nstruggling with long-form video understanding tasks. Recently, many long\nvideo-language understanding approaches have leveraged the reasoning\ncapabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform long video QA,\ntransforming videos into densely sampled frame captions, and asking LLMs to\nrespond to text queries over captions. However, the frames used for captioning\nare often redundant and contain irrelevant information, making dense sampling\ninefficient, and ignoring the fact that video QA requires varying levels of\ngranularity, with some video segments being highly relevant to the question\n(needing more fine-grained detail) while others being less relevant. Thus,\nthese LLM-based approaches are prone to missing information and operate on\nlarge numbers of irrelevant captions, lowering both performance and efficiency.\nTo address these issues, we introduce VideoTree, a query-adaptive and\nhierarchical framework for long-video understanding with LLMs. VideoTree\ndynamically extracts query-related information from a video and builds a\ntree-based representation for LLM reasoning. First, VideoTree adaptively\nselects frames for captioning by iteratively clustering frames based on their\nvisual features and scoring clusters using their relevance to the query.\nSecond, it organizes visual clusters into a query-adaptive and hierarchical\ntree structure; the tree encodes varying levels of granularity, with higher\nresolution on relevant segments. Finally, VideoTree produces an answer by\ntraversing the tree's keyframes and passing their captions to an LLM answerer.\nOur method improves both reasoning accuracy and efficiency compared to existing\nmethods: VideoTree achieves a 7.0%, 2.2%, and 2.7% accuracy gain over baselines\non the EgoSchema, NExT-QA, and IntentQA benchmarks, respectively, while\nreducing inference time by 40%.",

For instance, when trained on clearly\nsmiling and non-smiling faces, we demonstrate a sampling procedure which can\ngenerate slightly smiling faces without reference images (zero-shot\ninterpolation). We replicate these findings for other attributes as well as\nother datasets.\n$\\href{https://github.com/jdeschena/ddpm-zero-shot-interpolation}{\\text{Our\ncode is available on GitHub.}}$",

        "abstract": "Video text spotting aims to simultaneously localize, recognize and track text\ninstances in videos. To address the limited recognition capability of\nend-to-end methods, tracking the zero-shot results of state-of-the-art image\ntext spotters directly can achieve impressive performance. However, owing to\nthe domain gap between different datasets, these methods usually obtain limited\ntracking trajectories on extreme dataset. Fine-tuning transformer-based text\nspotters on specific datasets could yield performance enhancements, albeit at\nthe expense of considerable training resources. In this paper, we propose a\nLanguage Collaboration and Glyph Perception Model, termed LOGO to enhance the\nperformance of conventional text spotters through the integration of a synergy\nmodule. To achieve this goal, a language synergy classifier (LSC) is designed\nto explicitly discern text instances from background noise in the recognition\nstage. Specially, the language synergy classifier can output text content or\nbackground code based on the legibility of text regions, thus computing\nlanguage scores. Subsequently, fusion scores are computed by taking the average\nof detection scores and language scores, and are utilized to re-score the\ndetection results before tracking. By the re-scoring mechanism, the proposed\nLSC facilitates the detection of low-resolution text instances while filtering\nout text-like regions. Besides, the glyph supervision and visual position\nmixture module are proposed to enhance the recognition accuracy of noisy text\nregions, and acquire more discriminative tracking features, respectively.\nExtensive experiments on public benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.",

        "abstract": "High dimensional expanders (HDXs) are a hypergraph generalization of expander\ngraphs. They are extensively studied in the math and TCS communities due to\ntheir many applications. Like expander graphs, HDXs are especially interesting\nfor applications when they are bounded degree, namely, if the number of edges\nadjacent to every vertex is bounded. However, only a handful of constructions\nare known to have this property, all of which rely on non-trivial algebraic\ntechniques. In particular, no random or combinatorial construction of bounded\ndegree HDXs is known. As a result, our understanding of these objects is\nlimited.\n  The degree of an $i$-face in an HDX is the number of $(i+1)$-faces containing\nit. In this work we construct HDXs whose higher dimensional faces have bounded\ndegree. This is done by giving an elementary and deterministic algorithm that\ntakes as input a regular $k$-dimensional HDX $X$ and outputs another\n$k$-dimensional HDX $\\widehat{X}$ with twice as many vertices. While the degree\nof vertices in $\\widehat{X}$ grows, the degree of the $(k-1)$-faces in\n$\\widehat{X}$ stays the same. As a result, we obtain a new `algebra-free'\nconstruction of HDXs whose $(k-1)$-face degree is bounded.\n  Our algorithm is based on a simple and natural generalization of the\nconstruction by Bilu and Linial (Combinatorica, 2006), which build expanders\nusing lifts coming from edge signings. Our construction is based on local lifts\nof HDXs, where a local lift is a complex whose top-level links are lifts of\nlinks in the original complex. We demonstrate that a local lift of an HDX is an\nHDX in many cases.\n  In addition, combining local lifts with existing bounded degree constructions\ncreates new families of bounded degree HDXs with significantly different links\nthan before. We use this technique to construct bounded degree high dimensional\nexpanders with links that have arbitrarily large diameters.",

        "abstract": "With the great success of diffusion models (DMs) in generating realistic\nsynthetic vision data, many researchers have investigated their potential in\ndecision-making and control. Most of these works utilized DMs to sample\ndirectly from the trajectory space, where DMs can be viewed as a combination of\ndynamics models and policies. In this work, we explore how to decouple DMs'\nability as dynamics models in fully offline settings, allowing the learning\npolicy to roll out trajectories. As DMs learn the data distribution from the\ndataset, their intrinsic policy is actually the behavior policy induced from\nthe dataset, which results in a mismatch between the behavior policy and the\nlearning policy. We propose Dynamics Diffusion, short as DyDiff, which can\ninject information from the learning policy to DMs iteratively. DyDiff ensures\nlong-horizon rollout accuracy while maintaining policy consistency and can be\neasily deployed on model-free algorithms. We provide theoretical analysis to\nshow the advantage of DMs on long-horizon rollout over models and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of DyDiff in the context of offline reinforcement learning,\nwhere the rollout dataset is provided but no online environment for\ninteraction.

        "abstract": "Emerging discussions on the responsible government use of algorithmic\ntechnologies propose transparency and public participation as key mechanisms\nfor preserving accountability and trust. But in practice, the adoption and use\nof any technology shifts the social, organizational, and political context in\nwhich it is embedded. Therefore translating transparency and participation\nefforts into meaningful, effective accountability must take into account these\nshifts. We adopt two theoretical frames, Mulligan and Nissenbaum's handoff\nmodel and Star and Griesemer's boundary objects, to reveal such shifts during\nthe U.S. Census Bureau's adoption of differential privacy (DP) in its updated\ndisclosure avoidance system (DAS) for the 2020 census. This update preserved\n(and arguably strengthened) the confidentiality protections that the Bureau is\nmandated to uphold, and the Bureau engaged in a range of activities to\nfacilitate public understanding of and participation in the system design\nprocess. Using publicly available documents concerning the Census'\nimplementation of DP, this case study seeks to expand our understanding of how\ntechnical shifts implicate values, how such shifts can afford (or fail to\nafford) greater transparency and participation in system design, and the\nimportance of localized expertise throughout. We present three lessons from\nthis case study toward grounding understandings of algorithmic transparency and\nparticipation: (1) efforts towards transparency and participation in\nalgorithmic governance must center values and policy decisions, not just\ntechnical design decisions; (2) the handoff model is a useful tool for\nrevealing how such values may be cloaked beneath technical decisions; and (3)\nboundary objects alone cannot bridge distant communities without trusted\nexperts traveling alongside to broker their adoption.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP), is an extension of the classic\nVehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which is a fundamental problem in logistics and\ntransportation. Typically, DVRPs involve two stakeholders: service providers\nthat deliver services to customers and customers who raise requests from\ndifferent locations. Many real-world applications can be formulated as DVRP\nsuch as ridesharing and non-compliance capture. Apart from original objectives\nlike optimising total utility or efficiency, DVRP should also consider fairness\nfor all parties. Unfairness can induce service providers and customers to give\nup on the systems, leading to negative financial and social impacts. However,\nmost existing DVRP-related applications focus on improving fairness from a\nsingle side, and there have been few works considering two-sided fairness and\nutility optimisation concurrently. To this end, we propose a novel framework, a\nTwo-sided Fairness-aware Genetic Algorithm (named 2FairGA), which expands the\ngenetic algorithm from the original objective solely focusing on utility to\nmulti-objectives that incorporate two-sided fairness. Subsequently, the impact\nof injecting two fairness definitions into the utility-focused model and the\ncorrelation between any pair of the three objectives are explored.

This setting is an example of an application\nwith scarce data, i.e., only having available few data samples, while the input\nand output dimensions are high. In this scarce data setting, standard machine\nlearning methods are likely to ail. Therefore, we resort to greedy kernel\napproximation schemes that have shown to be efficient meshless approximation\ntechniques for multivariate functions. We demonstrate that such methods can\nefficiently be used in the high-dimensional input/output case under scarce\ndata. Especially, we show that the vectorial kernel orthogonal greedy\napproximation (VKOGA) procedure with a data-adapted two-layer kernel yields\nexcellent predictors for learning from 3D geometry voxel data via both\nmorphological descriptors or principal component analysis.",

Such operator learning\nmodels not only predict particular instances of a physical or biological system\nin real-time but also forecast classes of solutions corresponding to a\ndistribution of initial and boundary conditions or forcing terms. % DeepONet is\nthe first neural operator model and has been tested extensively for a broad\nclass of solutions, including Riemann problems. Transformers have not been used\nin that capacity, and specifically, they have not been tested for solutions of\nPDEs with low regularity. %\n  In this work, we first establish the theoretical groundwork that transformers\npossess the universal approximation property as operator learning models.\n  We then apply transformers to forecast solutions of diverse dynamical systems\nwith solutions of finite regularity for a plurality of initial conditions and\nforcing terms. In particular, we consider three examples: the Izhikevich neuron\nmodel, the tempered fractional-order Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, and\nthe one-dimensional Euler equation Riemann problem. For the latter problem, we\nalso compare with variants of DeepONet, and we find that transformers\noutperform DeepONet in accuracy but they are computationally more expensive.",

        "abstract": "Large autoregressive models like Transformers can solve tasks through\nin-context learning (ICL) without learning new weights, suggesting avenues for\nefficiently solving new tasks. For many tasks, e.g., linear regression, the\ndata factorizes: examples are independent given a task latent that generates\nthe data, e.g., linear coefficients. While an optimal predictor leverages this\nfactorization by inferring task latents, it is unclear if Transformers\nimplicitly do so or if they instead exploit heuristics and statistical\nshortcuts enabled by attention layers. Both scenarios have inspired active\nongoing work. In this paper, we systematically investigate the effect of\nexplicitly inferring task latents. We minimally modify the Transformer\narchitecture with a bottleneck designed to prevent shortcuts in favor of more\nstructured solutions, and then compare performance against standard\nTransformers across various ICL tasks. Contrary to intuition and some recent\nworks, we find little discernible difference between the two; biasing towards\ntask-relevant latent variables does not lead to better out-of-distribution\nperformance, in general. Curiously, we find that while the bottleneck\neffectively learns to extract latent task variables from context, downstream\nprocessing struggles to utilize them for robust prediction. Our study\nhighlights the intrinsic limitations of Transformers in achieving structured\nICL solutions that generalize, and shows that while inferring the right latents\naids interpretability, it is not sufficient to alleviate this problem.",

Still, plasticity\nloss has received less attention in the on-policy deep RL setting. Here we\nperform an extensive set of experiments examining plasticity loss and a variety\nof mitigation methods in on-policy deep RL.

Generally, the distractor\ngeneration can be classified into cloze-style distractor generation (CDG) and\nnatural questions distractor generation (NQDG). In contrast to the CDG,\nutilizing pre-trained language models (PLMs) for NQDG presents three primary\nchallenges: (1) PLMs are typically trained to generate ``correct'' content,\nlike answers, while rarely trained to generate ``plausible\" content, like\ndistractors; (2) PLMs often struggle to produce content that aligns well with\nspecific knowledge and the style of exams; (3) NQDG necessitates the model to\nproduce longer, context-sensitive, and question-relevant distractors.

Data dissemination is a fundamental problem\nin CEC to decide what data is transmitted from which device and how. Existing\nworks on data dissemination have not focused on coflow scheduling in CEC, which\ninvolves deciding the order of flows within and across coflows at network\nlinks. Coflow implies a set of parallel flows with a shared objective. The\nexisting works on coflow scheduling in data centers usually assume a\nnon-blocking switch and do not consider congestion at different links in the\nmulti-hop path in CEC, leading to increased coflow completion time (CCT).\nFurthermore, existing works do not consider multiple flow sources that cannot\nbe ignored, as data can have duplicate copies at different edge devices. This\nwork formulates the multi-source coflow scheduling problem in CEC, which\nincludes jointly deciding the source and flow ordering for multiple coflows to\nminimize the sum of CCT. This problem is shown to be NP-hard and challenging as\neach flow can have multiple dependent conflicts at multiple links. We propose a\nsource and coflow-aware search and adjust (SCASA) heuristic that first provides\nan initial solution considering the coflow characteristics. SCASA further\nimproves the initial solution using the source search and adjust heuristic by\nleveraging the knowledge of both coflows and network congestion at links.\nEvaluation done using simulation experiments shows that SCASA leads to up to\n83% reduction in the sum of CCT compared to benchmarks without a joint\nsolution.",

        "abstract": "Workloads in data processing clusters are often represented in the form of\nDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) jobs. Scheduling DAG jobs is challenging. Simple\nheuristic scheduling algorithms are often adopted in practice in production\ndata centres. There is much room for scheduling performance optimisation for\ncost saving. Recently, reinforcement learning approaches (like decima) have\nbeen attempted to optimise DAG job scheduling and demonstrate clear performance\ngain in comparison to traditional algorithms. However, reinforcement learning\n(RL) approaches face their own problems in real-world deployment. In\nparticular, their black-box decision making processes and generalizability in\nunseen workloads may add a non-trivial burden to the cluster administrators.\nMoreover, adapting RL models on unseen workloads often requires significant\namount of training data, which leaves edge cases run in a sub-optimal mode. To\nfill the gap, we propose a new method to distill a simple scheduling policy\nbased on observations of the behaviours of a complex deep learning model. The\nsimple model not only provides interpretability of scheduling decisions, but\nalso adaptive to edge cases easily through tuning. We show that our method\nachieves high fidelity to the decisions made by deep learning models and\noutperforms these models when additional heuristics are taken into account.",

Such information is invaluable for\nmonitoring large urban areas and supporting the implementation of\ndecision-making services. When analyzed in real time, NSD can enable the early\ndetection of critical urban events, including fires, large accidents,\nstampedes, terrorist attacks, and sports and leisure gatherings, especially if\nthese events significantly impact mobile phone network activity in the affected\nareas. This paper presents empirical evidence that advanced NSD can detect\nanomalies in mobile traffic service consumption, attributable to critical urban\nevents, with fine spatial and temporal resolutions. We introduce two\nmethodologies for real-time anomaly detection from multivariate time series\nextracted from large-scale NSD, utilizing a range of algorithms adapted from\nthe state-of-the-art in unsupervised machine learning techniques for anomaly\ndetection. Our research includes a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of\nthese algorithms on a large-scale dataset of NSD service consumption for the\nParis region. The evaluation uses an original dataset of documented critical or\nunusual urban events. This dataset has been built as a ground truth basis for\nassessing the algorithms performance. The obtained results demonstrate that our\nframework can detect unusual events almost instantaneously and locate the\naffected areas with high precision, largely outperforming random classifiers.\nThis efficiency and effectiveness underline the potential of NSD-based anomaly\ndetection in significantly enhancing emergency response strategies and urban\nplanning.",

However, key limitations of l-step MPGNNs\nare that their \"receptive field\" is typically limited to the l-hop neighborhood\nof a node and that information exchange between distant nodes is limited by\nover-squashing. Motivated by these limitations, we propose Spatio-Spectral\nGraph Neural Networks (S$^2$GNNs) -- a new modeling paradigm for Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) that synergistically combines spatially and spectrally\nparametrized graph filters. Parameterizing filters partially in the frequency\ndomain enables global yet efficient information propagation. We show that\nS$^2$GNNs vanquish over-squashing and yield strictly tighter\napproximation-theoretic error bounds than MPGNNs. Further, rethinking graph\nconvolutions at a fundamental level unlocks new design spaces. For example,\nS$^2$GNNs allow for free positional encodings that make them strictly more\nexpressive than the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test. Moreover, to obtain\ngeneral-purpose S$^2$GNNs, we propose spectrally parametrized filters for\ndirected graphs. S$^2$GNNs outperform spatial MPGNNs, graph transformers, and\ngraph rewirings, e.g., on the peptide long-range benchmark tasks, and are\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art sequence modeling.

        "abstract": "Task planning is emerging as an important research topic alongside the\ndevelopment of large language models (LLMs). It aims to break down complex user\nrequests into solvable sub-tasks, thereby fulfilling the original requests. In\nthis context, the sub-tasks can be naturally viewed as a graph, where the nodes\nrepresent the sub-tasks, and the edges denote the dependencies among them.\nConsequently, task planning is a decision-making problem that involves\nselecting a connected path or subgraph within the corresponding graph and\ninvoking it. In this paper, we explore graph learning-based methods for task\nplanning, a direction that is orthogonal to the prevalent focus on prompt\ndesign. Our interest in graph learning stems from a theoretical discovery: the\nbiases of attention and auto-regressive loss impede LLMs' ability to\neffectively navigate decision-making on graphs, which is adeptly addressed by\ngraph neural networks (GNNs). This theoretical insight led us to integrate GNNs\nwith LLMs to enhance overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat GNN-based methods surpass existing solutions even without training, and\nminimal training can further enhance their performance. Additionally, our\napproach complements prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques, with\nperformance further enhanced by improved prompts or a fine-tuned model.",

        "abstract": "Supervised deep learning approaches can artificially increase the resolution\nof microscopy images by learning a mapping between two image resolutions or\nmodalities. However, such methods often require a large set of hard-to-get\nlow-res/high-res image pairs and produce synthetic images with a moderate\nincrease in resolution. Conversely, recent methods based on GAN latent search\noffered a drastic increase in resolution without the need of paired images.\nHowever, they offer limited reconstruction of the high-resolution image\ninterpretable features. Here, we propose a robust super-resolution method based\non regularized latent search~(RLS) that offers an actionable balance between\nfidelity to the ground-truth and realism of the recovered image given a\ndistribution prior. The latter allows to split the analysis of a low-resolution\nimage into a computational super-resolution task performed by deep learning\nfollowed by a quantification task performed by a handcrafted algorithm and\nbased on interpretable biological features. This two-step process holds\npotential for various applications such as diagnostics on mobile devices, where\nthe main aim is not to recover the high-resolution details of a specific sample\nbut rather to obtain high-resolution images that preserve explainable and\nquantifiable differences between conditions.",

GPT-4o, the newest multimodal large\nlanguage model (MLLM) across audio, vision, and text, has further blurred the\nline between fiction and reality by enabling more natural human-computer\ninteractions. However, the advent of GPT-4o's voice mode may also introduce a\nnew attack surface. In this paper, we present the first systematic measurement\nof jailbreak attacks against the voice mode of GPT-4o. We show that GPT-4o\ndemonstrates good resistance to forbidden questions and text jailbreak prompts\nwhen directly transferring them to voice mode. This resistance is primarily due\nto GPT-4o's internal safeguards and the difficulty of adapting text jailbreak\nprompts to voice mode. Inspired by GPT-4o's human-like behaviors, we propose\nVoiceJailbreak, a novel voice jailbreak attack that humanizes GPT-4o and\nattempts to persuade it through fictional storytelling (setting, character, and\nplot). VoiceJailbreak is capable of generating simple, audible, yet effective\njailbreak prompts, which significantly increases the average attack success\nrate (ASR) from 0.033 to 0.778 in six forbidden scenarios. We also conduct\nextensive experiments to explore the impacts of interaction steps, key elements\nof fictional writing, and different languages on VoiceJailbreak's effectiveness\nand further enhance the attack performance with advanced fictional writing\ntechniques. We hope our study can assist the research community in building\nmore secure and well-regulated MLLMs.",

However, these models lack\ntask-specific knowledge therefore are not optimized for the nuances of\nrecognizing facial expressions. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a novel\nmethod, Exp-CLIP, to enhance zero-shot FER by transferring the task knowledge\nfrom large language models (LLMs). Specifically, based on the pre-trained\nvision-language encoders, we incorporate a projection head designed to map the\ninitial joint vision-language space into a space that captures representations\nof facial actions. To train this projection head for subsequent zero-shot\npredictions, we propose to align the projected visual representations with\ntask-specific semantic meanings derived from the LLM encoder, and the text\ninstruction-based strategy is employed to customize the LLM knowledge. Given\nunlabelled facial data and efficient training of the projection head, Exp-CLIP\nachieves superior zero-shot results to the CLIP models and several other large\nvision-language models (LVLMs) on seven in-the-wild FER datasets. The code and\npre-trained models are available at\n\\url{https://github.com/zengqunzhao/Exp-CLIP}.",

        "abstract": "Digital watermarking methods are commonly used to safeguard digital media\ncopyrights by confirming ownership and deterring unauthorized use. However,\nwithout reliable third-party oversight, these methods risk security\nvulnerabilities during watermark extraction.

This study introduces DataSafe, a copyright protection scheme that\ncombines physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and blockchain technology. PUF\ndevices use their unique fingerprints for blockchain registration.\nSubsequently, these devices incorporate invisible watermarking techniques to\nembed digital watermarks into media for copyright protection.

        "abstract": "This paper studies the challenging black-box adversarial attack that aims to\ngenerate adversarial examples against a black-box model by only using output\nfeedback of the model to input queries. Some previous methods improve the query\nefficiency by incorporating the gradient of a surrogate white-box model into\nquery-based attacks due to the adversarial transferability. However, the\nlocalized gradient is not informative enough, making these methods still\nquery-intensive. In this paper, we propose a Prior-guided Bayesian Optimization\n(P-BO) algorithm that leverages the surrogate model as a global function prior\nin black-box adversarial attacks. As the surrogate model contains rich prior\ninformation of the black-box one, P-BO models the attack objective with a\nGaussian process whose mean function is initialized as the surrogate model's\nloss. Our theoretical analysis on the regret bound indicates that the\nperformance of P-BO may be affected by a bad prior. Therefore, we further\npropose an adaptive integration strategy to automatically adjust a coefficient\non the function prior by minimizing the regret bound. Extensive experiments on\nimage classifiers and large vision-language models demonstrate the superiority\nof the proposed algorithm in reducing queries and improving attack success\nrates compared with the state-of-the-art black-box attacks.

The primary objective of ICD indexing is to allocate a subset of\nICD codes to a medical record, which facilitates standardized documentation and\nmanagement of various health conditions. Most existing approaches have suffered\nfrom selecting the proper label subsets from an extremely large ICD collection\nwith a heavy long-tailed label distribution. In this paper, we leverage a\nmulti-stage ``retrieve and re-rank'' framework as a novel solution to ICD\nindexing, via a hybrid discrete retrieval method, and re-rank retrieved\ncandidates with contrastive learning that allows the model to make more\naccurate predictions from a simplified label space. The retrieval model is a\nhybrid of auxiliary knowledge of the electronic health records (EHR) and a\ndiscrete retrieval method (BM25), which efficiently collects high-quality\ncandidates. In the last stage, we propose a label co-occurrence guided\ncontrastive re-ranking model, which re-ranks the candidate labels by pulling\ntogether the clinical notes with positive ICD codes.

We conduct extensive experiments based on the OpenAI\nGym, Meta-World, and Panda Robots environments, encompassing policy shifts\nunder stationary and nonstationary dynamics, as well as domain adaption. The\nresults demonstrate that OMPO outperforms the specialized baselines from\ndifferent categories in all settings. We also find that OMPO exhibits\nparticularly strong performance when combined with domain randomization,\nhighlighting its potential in RL-based robotics applications",

Motion compensation methods aim to correct such artifacts\npost-acquisition, often incorporating temporal smoothness constraints on the\nestimated motion patterns. This study analyzes the influence of a spline-based\nmotion model within an existing rigid motion compensation algorithm for\ncone-beam CT on the recoverable motion frequencies. Results demonstrate that\nthe choice of motion model crucially influences recoverable frequencies. The\noptimization-based motion compensation algorithm is able to accurately fit the\nspline nodes for frequencies almost up to the node-dependent theoretical limit\naccording to the Nyquist-Shannon theorem. Notably, a higher node count does not\ncompromise reconstruction performance for slow motion patterns, but can extend\nthe range of recoverable high frequencies for the investigated algorithm.\nEventually, the optimal motion model is dependent on the imaged anatomy,\nclinical use case, and scanning protocol and should be tailored carefully to\nthe expected motion frequency spectrum to ensure accurate motion compensation.",

Therefore, to reduce potential drift in the\nfeature extractor, existing exemplar-free methods are typically evaluated in\nsettings where the first task is significantly larger than subsequent tasks.\nTheir performance drops drastically in more challenging settings starting with\na smaller first task. To address this problem of feature drift estimation for\nexemplar-free methods, we propose to adversarially perturb the current samples\nsuch that their embeddings are close to the old class prototypes in the old\nmodel embedding space. We then estimate the drift in the embedding space from\nthe old to the new model using the perturbed images and compensate the\nprototypes accordingly. We exploit the fact that adversarial samples are\ntransferable from the old to the new feature space in a continual learning\nsetting. The generation of these images is simple and computationally cheap. We\ndemonstrate in our experiments that the proposed approach better tracks the\nmovement of prototypes in embedding space and outperforms existing methods on\nseveral standard continual learning benchmarks as well as on fine-grained\ndatasets.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel neural rendering\npipeline that accurately renders the scene behind transparent surfaces with\nglobal illumination and variable scenes. Our method separates the G-buffers of\nopaque and transparent objects, retaining G-buffer information behind\ntransparent objects.

        "abstract": "Distributing quantum states reliably among distant locations is a key\nchallenge in the field of quantum networks. One-way quantum networks address\nthis by using one-way communication and quantum error correction. Here, we\nanalyze quantum circuit switching as a protocol to distribute quantum states in\none-way quantum networks. In quantum circuit switching, pairs of users can\nrequest the delivery of multiple quantum states from one user to the other.\nAfter waiting for approval from the network, the states can be distributed\neither sequentially, forwarding one at a time along a path of quantum\nrepeaters, or in parallel, sending batches of quantum states from repeater to\nrepeater. Since repeaters can only forward a finite number of quantum states at\na time, a pivotal question arises: is it advantageous to send them sequentially\n(allowing for multiple requests simultaneously) or in parallel (reducing\nprocessing time but handling only one request at a time)? We compare both\napproaches in a quantum network with a star topology. Using tools from queuing\ntheory, we show that requests are met at a higher rate when packets are\ndistributed in parallel, although sequential distribution can generally provide\nservice to a larger number of users simultaneously. We also show that using a\nlarge number of quantum repeaters to combat channel losses limits the maximum\ndistance between users, as each repeater introduces additional processing\ndelays. These findings provide insight into the design of protocols for\ndistributing quantum states in one-way quantum networks.",

        "abstract": "Context detection involves labeling segments of an online stream of data as\nbelonging to different tasks. Task labels are used in lifelong learning\nalgorithms to perform consolidation or other procedures that prevent\ncatastrophic forgetting. Inferring task labels from online experiences remains\na challenging problem. Most approaches assume finite and low-dimension\nobservation spaces or a preliminary training phase during which task labels are\nlearned. Moreover, changes in the transition or reward functions can be\ndetected only in combination with a policy, and therefore are more difficult to\ndetect than changes in the input distribution. This paper presents an approach\nto learning both policies and labels in an online deep reinforcement learning\nsetting. The key idea is to use distance metrics, obtained via optimal\ntransport methods, i.e., Wasserstein distance, on suitable latent action-reward\nspaces to measure distances between sets of data points from past and current\nstreams. Such distances can then be used for statistical tests based on an\nadapted Kolmogorov-Smirnov calculation to assign labels to sequences of\nexperiences. A rollback procedure is introduced to learn multiple policies by\nensuring that only the appropriate data is used to train the corresponding\npolicy. The combination of task detection and policy deployment allows for the\noptimization of lifelong reinforcement learning agents without an oracle that\nprovides task labels. The approach is tested using two benchmarks and the\nresults show promising performance when compared with related context detection\nalgorithms. The results suggest that optimal transport statistical methods\nprovide an explainable and justifiable procedure for online context detection\nand reward optimization in lifelong reinforcement learning.",

A wide range of techniques exists to\naddress these questions, including static and stochastic optimization, bandits,\nmodel predictive control (MPC) and, indeed, RL.

First, it optimizes\nspeech-text alignment by minimizing the divergence between the LLM's next-token\nprediction distributions for speech and text inputs using knowledge\ndistillation. Second, it employs a continuous-integrate-andfire strategy to\nsegment speech into tokens that correspond one-to-one with text tokens,\nenabling fine-grained alignment.

Quantitative evaluation shows that BLSP-KD outperforms previous\nend-to-end baselines and cascaded systems with comparable scale of parameters,\nfacilitating general instruction-following capabilities for LLMs with speech\ninputs.

The study emphasizes the significant\nrole of textual information compared to visual data in providing a deep\nunderstanding of items. We conducted sensitivity analyses to understand how\ndifferent modalities and the use of purifier circle loss affect the efficiency\nof the model. The findings indicate that systems that incorporate multiple\nmodalities perform better than those relying on just one modality.

In this work, we design a dual-functional blockchain\nframework that uses solving optimization problems to reach consensus as an\nalternative to PoW, channeling wasted resources into useful work. We model and\nanalyze our framework by developing discrete Markov chains, and derive the\nsecurity conditions to ensure that selfish miners behave honestly. Based on the\nsecurity conditions, we derive a lower bound for the security overhead and\nanalyze the trade-off between useful work efficiency and PoW safeguard. We\nfurther dive deep into the reward function design for the proposed\ndual-functional blockchain and provide practical design guidelines for reward\nfunctions assuming concavity and linearity respectively.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made them indispensable,\nraising significant concerns over managing their safety. Automated red teaming\noffers a promising alternative to the labor-intensive and error-prone manual\nprobing for vulnerabilities, providing more consistent and scalable safety\nevaluations. However, existing approaches often compromise diversity by\nfocusing on maximizing attack success rate. Additionally, methods that decrease\nthe cosine similarity from historical embeddings with semantic diversity\nrewards lead to novelty stagnation as history grows. To address these issues,\nwe introduce DiveR-CT, which relaxes conventional constraints on the objective\nand semantic reward, granting greater freedom for the policy to enhance\ndiversity. Our experiments demonstrate DiveR-CT's marked superiority over\nbaselines by 1) generating data that perform better in various diversity\nmetrics across different attack success rate levels, 2) better-enhancing\nresiliency in blue team models through safety tuning based on collected data,\n3) allowing dynamic control of objective weights for reliable and controllable\nattack success rates, and 4) reducing susceptibility to reward\noveroptimization.

        "abstract": "We consider inverse reinforcement learning problems with concave utilities.\nConcave Utility Reinforcement Learning (CURL) is a generalisation of the\nstandard RL objective, which employs a concave function of the state occupancy\nmeasure, rather than a linear function. CURL has garnered recent attention for\nits ability to represent instances of many important applications including the\nstandard RL such as imitation learning, pure exploration, constrained MDPs,\noffline RL, human-regularized RL, and others. Inverse reinforcement learning is\na powerful paradigm that focuses on recovering an unknown reward function that\ncan rationalize the observed behaviour of an agent. There has been recent\ntheoretical advances in inverse RL where the problem is formulated as\nidentifying the set of feasible reward functions. However, inverse RL for CURL\nproblems has not been considered previously. In this paper we show that most of\nthe standard IRL results do not apply to CURL in general, since CURL\ninvalidates the classical Bellman equations. This calls for a new theoretical\nframework for the inverse CURL problem. Using a recent equivalence result\nbetween CURL and Mean-field Games, we propose a new definition for the feasible\nrewards for I-CURL by proving that this problem is equivalent to an inverse\ngame theory problem in a subclass of mean-field games. We present initial query\nand sample complexity results for the I-CURL problem under assumptions such as\nLipschitz-continuity.

        "abstract": "Automation of hydraulic material handling machinery is currently limited to\nsemi-static pick-and-place cycles. Dynamic throwing motions which utilize the\npassive joints, can greatly improve time efficiency as well as increase the\ndumping workspace. In this work, we use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to design\ndynamic controllers for material handlers with underactuated arms as commonly\nused in logistics. The controllers are tested both in simulation and in\nreal-world experiments on a 12-ton test platform. The method is able to exploit\nthe passive joints of the gripper to perform dynamic throwing motions. With the\nproposed controllers, the machine is able to throw individual objects to\ntargets outside the static reachability zone with good accuracy for its\npractical applications. The work demonstrates the possibility of using RL to\nperform highly dynamic tasks with heavy machinery, suggesting a potential for\nimproving the efficiency and precision of autonomous material handling tasks.",

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of machine learning\nmodels on decentralized data while preserving data privacy. However, data\nacross clients often differs significantly due to class imbalance, feature\ndistribution skew, sample size imbalance, and other phenomena. Leveraging\ninformation from these not identically distributed (non-IID) datasets poses\nsubstantial challenges. FL methods based on a single global model cannot\neffectively capture the variations in client data and underperform in non-IID\nsettings. Consequently, Personalized FL (PFL) approaches that adapt to each\nclient's data distribution but leverage other clients' data are essential but\ncurrently underexplored. We propose a novel Bayesian PFL framework using\nbi-level optimization to tackle the data heterogeneity challenges. Our proposed\nframework utilizes the global model as a prior distribution within a Maximum A\nPosteriori (MAP) estimation of personalized client models. This approach\nfacilitates PFL by integrating shared knowledge from the prior, thereby\nenhancing local model performance, generalization ability, and communication\nefficiency. We extensively evaluated our bi-level optimization approach on\nreal-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in\nmodel accuracy compared to existing methods while reducing communication\noverhead.

Due\nto the intractable densities of semi-implicit distributions, classical SIVI\noften resorts to surrogates of evidence lower bound (ELBO) that would introduce\nbiases for training. A recent advancement in SIVI, named SIVI-SM, utilizes an\nalternative score matching objective made tractable via a minimax formulation,\nalbeit requiring an additional lower-level optimization. In this paper, we\npropose kernel SIVI (KSIVI), a variant of SIVI-SM that eliminates the need for\nlower-level optimization through kernel tricks. Specifically, we show that when\noptimizing over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), the lower-level\nproblem has an explicit solution. This way, the upper-level objective becomes\nthe kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD), which is readily computable for stochastic\ngradient descent due to the hierarchical structure of semi-implicit variational\ndistributions. An upper bound for the variance of the Monte Carlo gradient\nestimators of the KSD objective is derived, which allows us to establish novel\nconvergence guarantees of KSIVI.

        "abstract": "Deep learning has significantly advanced time series forecasting through its\npowerful capacity to capture sequence relationships. However, training these\nmodels with the Mean Square Error (MSE) loss often results in over-smooth\npredictions, making it challenging to handle the complexity and learn\nhigh-entropy features from time series data with high variability and\nunpredictability. In this work, we introduce a novel approach by tokenizing\ntime series values to train forecasting models via cross-entropy loss, while\nconsidering the continuous nature of time series data. Specifically, we propose\nHierarchical Classification Auxiliary Network, HCAN, a general model-agnostic\ncomponent that can be integrated with any forecasting model. HCAN is based on a\nHierarchy-Aware Attention module that integrates multi-granularity high-entropy\nfeatures at different hierarchy levels. At each level, we assign a class label\nfor timesteps to train an Uncertainty-Aware Classifier. This classifier\nmitigates the over-confidence in softmax loss via evidence theory. We also\nimplement a Hierarchical Consistency Loss to maintain prediction consistency\nacross hierarchy levels. Extensive experiments integrating HCAN with\nstate-of-the-art forecasting models demonstrate substantial improvements over\nbaselines on several real-world datasets.

        "abstract": "Partially class-disjoint data (PCDD), a common yet under-explored data\nformation where each client contributes a part of classes (instead of all\nclasses) of samples, severely challenges the performance of federated\nalgorithms. Without full classes, the local objective will contradict the\nglobal objective, yielding the angle collapse problem for locally missing\nclasses and the space waste problem for locally existing classes. As far as we\nknow, none of the existing methods can intrinsically mitigate PCDD challenges\nto achieve holistic improvement in the bilateral views (both global view and\nlocal view) of federated learning. To address this dilemma, we are inspired by\nthe strong generalization of simplex Equiangular Tight Frame~(ETF) on the\nimbalanced data, and propose a novel approach called FedGELA where the\nclassifier is globally fixed as a simplex ETF while locally adapted to the\npersonal distributions. Globally, FedGELA provides fair and equal\ndiscrimination for all classes and avoids inaccurate updates of the classifier,\nwhile locally it utilizes the space of locally missing classes for locally\nexisting classes. We conduct extensive experiments on a range of datasets to\ndemonstrate that our FedGELA achieves promising performance~(averaged\nimprovement of 3.9% to FedAvg and 1.5% to best baselines) and provide both\nlocal and global convergence guarantees.

By incorporating weather and time-of-day information as an\nembedding structure, a novel WTTFNet based on gate multimodal unit is used to\nfuse the multimodal information and deep representation of trajectories. A\njoint loss function based on focal loss is used to co-optimize both the deep\ntrajectory features and final classifier, which helps to improve the accuracy\nin predicting the intended destination of pedestrians and hence the\ntrajectories under possible scenarios of class imbalances. Experimental results\nusing the Osaka Asia and Pacific Trade Center (ATC) dataset shows improved\nperformance of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art algorithms by 23.67%\nincrease in classification accuracy, 9.16% and 7.07% reduction of average and\nfinal displacement error.

        "abstract": "Existing heterogeneous graph neural network algorithms (HGNNs) mostly rely on\nmeta-paths to capture the rich semantic information contained in heterogeneous\ngraphs (also known as heterogeneous information networks (HINs)), but most of\nthese HGNNs focus on different ways of feature aggre gation and ignore the\nproperties of the meta-paths themselves. This paper studies meta-paths in three\ncommonly used data sets and finds that there are huge differences in the number\nof neighbors connected by different meta paths. At the same time, the noise\ninformation contained in large neigh bor paths will have an adverse impact on\nmodel performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a Heterogeneous Graph Neural\nNetwork Classification and Aggregation Algorithm Based on Large and Small\nNeighbor Path Iden tification(LSPI). LSPI firstly divides the meta-paths into\nlarge and small neighbor paths through the path discriminator , and in order to\nreduce the noise interference problem in large neighbor paths, LSPI selects\nneighbor nodes with higher similarity from both topology and feature\nperspectives, and passes small neighbor paths and filtered large neighbor paths\nthrough different graph convolution components. Aggregation is performed to\nobtain feature information under different subgraphs, and then LSPI uses\nsubgraph level attention to fuse the feature information under different\nsubgraphs to generate the final node embedding. Finally this paper verifies the\nsuperiority of the method through extensive experiments and also gives\nsuggestions on the number of nodes to be retained in large neighbor paths\nthrough exper iments.

In practical applications, it is important for DNNs to have both\nhigh standard accuracy and robustness against out-of-distribution domains. One\ntechnique that achieves both of these improvements is disentangled learning\nwith mixture distribution via auxiliary batch normalization layers (ABNs). This\ntechnique treats clean and transformed samples as different domains, allowing a\nDNN to learn better features from mixed domains. However, if we distinguish the\ndomains of the samples based on entropy, we find that some transformed samples\nare drawn from the same domain as clean samples, and these samples are not\ncompletely different domains. To generate samples drawn from a completely\ndifferent domain than clean samples, we hypothesize that transforming clean\nhigh-entropy samples to further increase the entropy generates\nout-of-distribution samples that are much further away from the in-distribution\ndomain. On the basis of the hypothesis, we propose high entropy\npropagation~(EntProp), which feeds high-entropy samples to the network that\nuses ABNs. We introduce two techniques, data augmentation and free adversarial\ntraining, that increase entropy and bring the sample further away from the\nin-distribution domain.

A\nwell-known problem encountered in this setting is the so-called catastrophic\nforgetting, for which the learning model is inclined to focus on more recent\ntasks while forgetting the previously learned knowledge. The majority of the\ncurrent approaches in FCL propose generative-based solutions to solve said\nproblem.

        "abstract": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has made remarkable progress over the past\nyears. However, under-translation and over-translation remain two challenging\nproblems in state-of-the-art NMT systems. In this work, we conduct an in-depth\nanalysis on the underlying cause of under-translation in NMT, providing an\nexplanation from the perspective of decoding objective. To optimize the beam\nsearch objective, the model tends to overlook words it is less confident about,\nleading to the under-translation phenomenon. Correspondingly, the model's\nconfidence in predicting the End Of Sentence (EOS) diminishes when\nunder-translation occurs, serving as a mild penalty for under-translated\ncandidates. Building upon this analysis, we propose employing the confidence of\npredicting EOS as a detector for under-translation, and strengthening the\nconfidence-based penalty to penalize candidates with a high risk of\nunder-translation. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that\nour method can accurately detect and rectify under-translated outputs, with\nminor impact on other correct translations.",

Unlike high-thrust transfers,\nlow-thrust trajectories require solving complex optimal control problems. This\ncomplexity grows exponentially with the number of asteroids visited due to\norbital mechanics intricacies. In the literature, methods for approximating\nlow-thrust transfers without full optimization have been proposed, including\nanalytical and machine learning techniques. In this work, we propose new\nanalytical approximations and compare their accuracy and performance to machine\nlearning methods. While analytical approximations leverage orbit theory to\nestimate trajectory costs, machine learning employs a more black-box approach,\nutilizing neural networks to predict optimal transfers based on various\nattributes. We build a dataset of about 3 million transfers, found by solving\nthe time and fuel optimal control problems, for different time of flights,\nwhich we also release open-source. Comparison between the two methods on this\ndatabase reveals the superiority of machine learning, especially for longer\ntransfers.

Subsequently, we conduct a joint analysis of\nthe causal relevance among the context, CoT, and answer during reasoning.

Maximum likelihood estimation is\ntypically performed by minimizing the log-likelihood loss, also known as the\nlogarithmic score in statistical decision theory. The logarithmic score is\nstrictly proper in the sense that it encourages honest forecasts, where the\nexpected score is maximized only when the model reports true probabilities.\nAlthough many strictly proper scoring rules exist, the logarithmic score is the\nonly local scoring rule among them that depends exclusively on the probability\nof the observed sample, making it capable of handling the exponentially large\nsample space of natural text. In this work, we propose a straightforward\nstrategy for adapting scoring rules to language generation, allowing for\nlanguage modeling with any non-local scoring rules. Leveraging this strategy,\nwe train language generation models using two classic strictly proper scoring\nrules, the Brier score and the Spherical score, as alternatives to the\nlogarithmic score. Experimental results indicate that simply substituting the\nloss function, without adjusting other hyperparameters, can yield substantial\nimprovements in model's generation capabilities.

        "abstract": "In response to the challenges posed by the extensive parameter updates\nrequired for full fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained models,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, exemplified by Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA), have emerged. LoRA simplifies the fine-tuning process but\nmay still struggle with a certain level of redundancy in low-rank matrices and\nlimited effectiveness from merely increasing their rank. To address these\nissues, a natural idea is to enhance the independence and diversity of the\nlearning process for the low-rank matrices. Therefore, we propose Masked LoRA\nExperts (MLAE), an innovative approach that applies the concept of masking to\nPEFT. Our method incorporates a cellular decomposition strategy that transforms\na low-rank matrix into independent rank-1 submatrices, or ``experts'', thus\nenhancing independence. Additionally, we introduce a binary mask matrix that\nselectively activates these experts during training to promote more diverse and\nanisotropic learning, based on expert-level dropout strategies. Our\ninvestigations reveal that this selective activation not only enhances\nperformance but also fosters a more diverse acquisition of knowledge with a\nmarked decrease in parameter similarity among MLAE, significantly boosting the\nquality of the model while barely increasing the parameter count. Remarkably,\nMLAE achieves new SOTA performance with an average accuracy score of 78.8% on\nthe VTAB-1k benchmark and 90.9% on the FGVC benchmark, demonstrating superior\nperformance.

        "abstract": "When developing empirical equations, domain experts require these to be\naccurate and adhere to physical laws. Often, constants with unknown units need\nto be discovered alongside the equations. Traditional unit-aware genetic\nprogramming (GP) approaches cannot be used when unknown constants with\nundetermined units are included. This paper presents a method for dimensional\nanalysis that propagates unknown units as ''jokers'' and returns the magnitude\nof unit violations. We propose three methods, namely evolutive culling, a\nrepair mechanism, and a multi-objective approach, to integrate the dimensional\nanalysis in the GP algorithm. Experiments on datasets with ground truth\ndemonstrate comparable performance of evolutive culling and the multi-objective\napproach to a baseline without dimensional analysis. Extensive analysis of the\nresults on datasets without ground truth reveals that the unit-aware algorithms\nmake only low sacrifices in accuracy, while producing unit-adherent solutions.\nOverall, we presented a promising novel approach for developing unit-adherent\nempirical equations.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18894v1",
        "abstract": "The performance of deep learning algorithms such as neural networks (NNs) has\nincreased tremendously recently, and they can achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance in many domains. However, due to memory and computation resource\nconstraints, implementing NNs on edge devices is a challenging task. Therefore,\nhardware accelerators such as computation-in-memory (CIM) with memristive\ndevices have been developed to accelerate the most common operations, i.e.,\nmatrix-vector multiplication. However, due to inherent device properties,\nexternal environmental factors such as temperature, and an immature fabrication\nprocess, memristors suffer from various non-idealities, including defects and\nvariations occurring during manufacturing and runtime. Consequently, there is a\nlack of complete confidence in the predictions made by the model. To improve\nconfidence in NN predictions made by hardware accelerators in the presence of\ndevice non-idealities, in this paper, we propose a Bayesian test vector\ngeneration framework that can estimate the model uncertainty of NNs implemented\non memristor-based CIM hardware. Compared to the conventional point estimate\ntest vector generation method, our method is more generalizable across\ndifferent model dimensions and requires storing only one test Bayesian vector\nin the hardware. Our method is evaluated on different model dimensions, tasks,\nfault rates, and variation noise to show that it can consistently achieve\n$100\\%$ coverage with only $0.024$ MB of memory overhead.",

        "abstract": "We analyze the uplink performance of a distributed massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) architecture in which the remotely located access points\n(APs) are connected to a central processing unit via a fiber-optical fronthaul\ncarrying a dithered and 1-bit quantized version of the received radio-frequency\n(RF) signal. The innovative feature of the proposed architecture is that no\ndown-conversion is performed at the APs. This eliminates the need to equip the\nAPs with local oscillators, which may be difficult to synchronize. Under the\nassumption that a constraint is imposed on the amount of data that can be\nexchanged across the fiber-optical fronthaul, we investigate the tradeoff\nbetween spatial oversampling, defined in terms of the total number of APs, and\ntemporal oversampling, defined in terms of the oversampling factor selected at\nthe central processing unit, to facilitate the recovery of the transmitted\nsignal from 1-bit samples of the RF received signal. Using the so-called\nerror-vector magnitude (EVM) as performance metric, we shed light on the\noptimal design of the dither signal, and quantify, for a given number of APs,\nthe minimum fronthaul rate required for our proposed distributed massive MIMO\narchitecture to outperform a standard co-located massive MIMO architecture in\nterms of EVM.",

        "abstract": "Money laundering presents a pervasive challenge, burdening society by\nfinancing illegal activities. To more effectively combat and detect money\nlaundering, the use of network information is increasingly being explored,\nexploiting that money laundering necessarily involves interconnected parties.\nThis has lead to a surge in literature on network analytics (NA) for anti-money\nlaundering (AML). The literature, however, is fragmented and a comprehensive\noverview of existing work is missing. This results in limited understanding of\nthe methods that may be applied and their comparative detection power.\nTherefore, this paper presents an extensive and systematic review of the\nliterature. We identify and analyse 97 papers in the Web of Science and Scopus\ndatabases, resulting in a taxonomy of approaches following the fraud analytics\nframework of Bockel-Rickermann et al.. Moreover, this paper presents a\ncomprehensive experimental framework to evaluate and compare the performance of\nprominent NA methods in a uniform setup. The framework is applied on the\npublicly available Elliptic data set and implements manual feature engineering,\nrandom walk-based methods, and deep learning GNNs. We conclude from the results\nthat network analytics increases the predictive power of the AML model with\ngraph neural networks giving the best results. An open source implementation of\nthe experimental framework is provided to facilitate researchers and\npractitioners to extend upon these results and experiment on proprietary data.\nAs such, we aim to promote a standardised approach towards the analysis and\nevaluation of network analytics for AML.",

        "abstract": "In federated learning (FL), the multi-step update and data heterogeneity\namong clients often lead to a loss landscape with sharper minima, degenerating\nthe performance of the resulted global model. Prevalent federated approaches\nincorporate sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) into local training to mitigate\nthis problem. However, the local loss landscapes may not accurately reflect the\nflatness of global loss landscape in heterogeneous environments; as a result,\nminimizing local sharpness and calculating perturbations on client data might\nnot align the efficacy of SAM in FL with centralized training. To overcome this\nchallenge, we propose FedLESAM, a novel algorithm that locally estimates the\ndirection of global perturbation on client side as the difference between\nglobal models received in the previous active and current rounds. Besides the\nimproved quality, FedLESAM also speed up federated SAM-based approaches since\nit only performs once backpropagation in each iteration. Theoretically, we\nprove a slightly tighter bound than its original FedSAM by ensuring consistent\nperturbation. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments on four\nfederated benchmark datasets under three partition strategies to demonstrate\nthe superior performance and efficiency of FedLESAM.",

        "abstract": "The prohibitive sizes of Large Language Models (LLMs) today make it difficult\nto deploy them on memory-constrained edge devices. This work introduces $\\rm\nCALDERA$ -- a new post-training LLM compression algorithm that harnesses the\ninherent low-rank structure of a weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}$ by approximating it\nvia a low-rank, low-precision decomposition as $\\mathbf{W} \\approx \\mathbf{Q} +\n\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{R}$. Here, $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ are low rank\nfactors, and the entries of $\\mathbf{Q}$, $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ are\nquantized. The model is compressed by substituting each layer with its\n$\\mathbf{Q} + \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{R}$ decomposition, and the zero-shot\nperformance of the compressed model is evaluated. Additionally, $\\mathbf{L}$\nand $\\mathbf{R}$ are readily amenable to low-rank adaptation, consequently\nenhancing the zero-shot performance. $\\rm CALDERA$ obtains this decomposition\nby formulating it as an optimization problem\n$\\min_{\\mathbf{Q},\\mathbf{L},\\mathbf{R}}\\lVert(\\mathbf{Q} +\n\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{R} - \\mathbf{W})\\mathbf{X}^\\top\\rVert_{\\rm F}^2$, where\n$\\mathbf{X}$ is the calibration data, and $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{L}, \\mathbf{R}$\nare constrained to be representable using low-precision formats.

The generality of MEGO is\nvalidated across six problem classes, including three classic problem classes\nand three problem classes arising from real-world applications in compilers,\nnetwork analysis, and 3D reconstruction. Trained solely on classic problem\nclasses, MEGO performs very well on all six problem classes, significantly\nsurpassing widely used general-purpose optimizers in both solution quality and\nefficiency.

The central goal of the alignment\nproblem is to adjust the distribution learned by diffusion models such that the\ngenerated samples maximize the target reward function. We propose a novel\nalignment approach, named Direct Noise Optimization (DNO), that optimizes the\ninjected noise during the sampling process of diffusion models. By design, DNO\nis tuning-free and prompt-agnostic, as the alignment occurs in an online\nfashion during generation.

To remedy this issue, we leverage classical high-dimensional\nstatistics theory and propose to augment the DNO loss with certain probability\nregularization. We conduct extensive experiments on several popular reward\nfunctions trained on human feedback data and demonstrate that the proposed DNO\napproach achieves state-of-the-art reward scores as well as high image quality,\nall within a reasonable time budget for generation.",

CGProNet employs higher-order\ngraph filters, optimizing the model with fewer parameters, reducing memory\nusage, and improving runtime efficiency. We present a comprehensive theoretical\nand experimental stability analysis, highlighting key aspects of CGProNet.\nExperiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate CGProNet's superior\nefficiency, minimizing memory and time requirements while maintaining\ncompetitive forecasting performance.",

        "abstract": "Handling missing data is crucial in machine learning, but many datasets\ncontain gaps due to errors or non-response. Unlike traditional methods such as\nlistwise deletion, which are simple but inadequate, the literature offers more\nsophisticated and effective methods, thereby improving sample size and\naccuracy. However, these methods require accessing the whole dataset, which\ncontradicts the privacy regulations when the data is distributed among multiple\nsources. Especially in the medical and healthcare domain, such access reveals\nsensitive information about patients. This study addresses privacy-preserving\nimputation methods for sensitive data using secure multi-party computation,\nenabling secure computations without revealing any party's sensitive\ninformation. In this study, we realized the mean, median, regression, and kNN\nimputation methods in a privacy-preserving way. We specifically target the\nmedical and healthcare domains considering the significance of protection of\nthe patient data, showcasing our methods on a diabetes dataset. Experiments on\nthe diabetes dataset validated the correctness of our privacy-preserving\nimputation methods, yielding the largest error around $3 \\times 10^{-3}$,\nclosely matching plaintext methods. We also analyzed the scalability of our\nmethods to varying numbers of samples, showing their applicability to\nreal-world healthcare problems. Our analysis demonstrated that all our methods\nscale linearly with the number of samples. Except for kNN, the runtime of all\nour methods indicates that they can be utilized for large datasets.",

In a blockchain, information is\ntransmitted through transactions issued by participants or applications. Miners\ncrucially select, order, and validate pending transactions for block inclusion,\nprioritizing those with higher incentives or fees. The order in which\ntransactions are included can impact the blockchain final state. Moreover,\napplications running on top of a blockchain often rely on governance protocols\nto decentralize the decision-making power to make changes to their core\nfunctionality. These changes can affect how participants interact with these\napplications. Since one token equals one vote, participants holding multiple\ntokens have a higher voting power to support or reject the proposed changes.\nThe extent to which this voting power is distributed is questionable and if\nhighly concentrated among a few holders can lead to governance attacks. In this\nthesis, we audit the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains to investigate the norms\nfollowed by miners in determining the transaction prioritization. We also audit\ndecentralized governance protocols such as Compound to evaluate whether the\nvoting power is fairly distributed among the participants.

        "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely employed for image\nSuper-Resolution (SR) in recent years. Various techniques enhance SR\nperformance by altering CNN structures or incorporating improved self-attention\nmechanisms. Interestingly, these advancements share a common trait. Instead of\nexplicitly learning high-frequency details, they learn an implicit feature\nprocessing mode that utilizes weighted sums of a feature map's own elements for\nreconstruction, akin to convolution and non-local. In contrast, early\ndictionary-based approaches learn feature decompositions explicitly to match\nand rebuild Low-Resolution (LR) features. Building on this analysis, we\nintroduce Trainable Feature Matching (TFM) to amalgamate this explicit feature\nlearning into CNNs, augmenting their representation capabilities. Within TFM,\ntrainable feature sets are integrated to explicitly learn features from\ntraining images through feature matching. Furthermore, we integrate non-local\nand channel attention into our proposed Trainable Feature Matching Attention\nNetwork (TFMAN) to further enhance SR performance. To alleviate the\ncomputational demands of non-local operations, we propose a streamlined variant\ncalled Same-size-divided Region-level Non-Local (SRNL). SRNL conducts non-local\ncomputations in parallel on blocks uniformly divided from the input feature\nmap. The efficacy of TFM and SRNL is validated through ablation studies and\nmodule explorations. We employ a recurrent convolutional network as the\nbackbone of our TFMAN to optimize parameter utilization. Comprehensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TFMAN achieves superior\nresults in most comparisons while using fewer parameters.

Separating\nautomata are an interesting class of automata that occurs generally in regular\nmodel checking and has raised interest in foundational questions of parity game\nsolving. We first propose a simple and linear-time algorithm that incrementally\nconstructs a three-valued DFA (3DFA) from a set of labelled samples given in\nthe usual lexicographical order. This 3DFA has accepting and rejecting states\nas well as don't-care states, so that it can exactly recognise the labelled\nexamples. We then apply our tool to mining a minimal separating DFA for the\nlabelled samples by minimising the constructed automata via a reduction to\nsolving SAT problems. Empirical evaluation shows that our tool outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art tools significantly on standard benchmarks for\nlearning minimal separating DFAs from samples. Progress in the efficient\nconstruction of separating DFAs can also lead to finding the lower bound of\nparity game solving, where we show that DFAMiner can create optimal separating\nautomata for simple languages with up to 7 colours.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a Domain-Inspired Sharpness-Aware Minimization (DISAM)\nalgorithm for optimization under domain shifts. It is motivated by the\ninconsistent convergence degree of SAM across different domains, which induces\noptimization bias towards certain domains and thus impairs the overall\nconvergence. To address this issue, we consider the domain-level convergence\nconsistency in the sharpness estimation to prevent the overwhelming (deficient)\nperturbations for less (well) optimized domains. Specifically, DISAM introduces\nthe constraint of minimizing variance in the domain loss, which allows the\nelastic gradient calibration in perturbation generation: when one domain is\noptimized above the averaging level \\textit{w.r.t.} loss, the gradient\nperturbation towards that domain will be weakened automatically, and vice\nversa. Under this mechanism, we theoretically show that DISAM can achieve\nfaster overall convergence and improved generalization in principle when\ninconsistent convergence emerges. Extensive experiments on various domain\ngeneralization benchmarks show the superiority of DISAM over a range of\nstate-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show the superior efficiency of DISAM\nin parameter-efficient fine-tuning combined with the pretraining models.

        "abstract": "As Embodied AI advances, it increasingly enables robots to handle the\ncomplexity of household manipulation tasks more effectively. However, the\napplication of robots in these settings remains limited due to the scarcity of\nbimanual-mobile robot manipulation datasets. Existing datasets either focus\nsolely on simple grasping tasks using single-arm robots without mobility, or\ncollect sensor data limited to a narrow scope of sensory inputs. As a result,\nthese datasets often fail to encapsulate the intricate and dynamic nature of\nreal-world tasks that bimanual-mobile robots are expected to perform. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce BRMData, a Bimanual-mobile Robot\nManipulation Dataset designed specifically for household applications. The\ndataset includes 10 diverse household tasks, ranging from simple single-arm\nmanipulation to more complex dual-arm and mobile manipulations. It is collected\nusing multi-view and depth-sensing data acquisition strategies. Human-robot\ninteractions and multi-object manipulations are integrated into the task\ndesigns to closely simulate real-world household applications. Moreover, we\npresent a Manipulation Efficiency Score (MES) metric to evaluate both the\nprecision and efficiency of robot manipulation methods. BRMData aims to drive\nthe development of versatile robot manipulation technologies, specifically\nfocusing on advancing imitation learning methods from human demonstrations. The\ndataset is now open-sourced and available at https://embodiedrobot.github.io/,\nenhancing research and development efforts in the field of Embodied\nManipulation.",

        "abstract": "Visual-based perception is the key module for autonomous driving. Among those\nvisual perception tasks, video object detection is a primary yet challenging\none because of feature degradation caused by fast motion or multiple poses.\nCurrent models usually aggregate features from the neighboring frames to\nenhance the object representations for the task heads to generate more accurate\npredictions. Though getting better performance, these methods rely on the\ninformation from the future frames and suffer from high computational\ncomplexity. Meanwhile, the aggregation process is not reconfigurable during the\ninference time. These issues make most of the existing models infeasible for\nonline applications. To solve these problems, we introduce a stepwise spatial\nglobal-local aggregation network. Our proposed models mainly contain three\nparts: 1). Multi-stage stepwise network gradually refines the predictions and\nobject representations from the previous stage; 2). Spatial global-local\naggregation fuses the local information from the neighboring frames and global\nsemantics from the current frame to eliminate the feature degradation; 3).\nDynamic aggregation strategy stops the aggregation process early based on the\nrefinement results to remove redundancy and improve efficiency.

Recent advances in\nself-supervised learning have shown great promise in this regard. However, many\nof the most successful self-supervised anomaly detection methods assume prior\nknowledge about the structure of anomalies and leverage synthetic anomalies\nduring training.

Vision-language foundation models, especially\nCLIP, have recently emerged as powerful tools for acquiring open-vocabulary\ncapabilities. However, fine-tuning CLIP to equip it with pixel-level prediction\nability often suffers three issues: 1) high computational cost, 2) misalignment\nbetween the two inherent modalities of CLIP, and 3) degraded generalization\nability on unseen categories. To address these issues, we propose H-CLIP a\nsymmetrical parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy conducted in\nhyperspherical space for both of the two CLIP modalities. Specifically, the\nPEFT strategy is achieved by a series of efficient block-diagonal learnable\ntransformation matrices and a dual cross-relation communication module among\nall learnable matrices. Since the PEFT strategy is conducted symmetrically to\nthe two CLIP modalities, the misalignment between them is mitigated.\nFurthermore, we apply an additional constraint to PEFT on the CLIP text encoder\naccording to the hyperspherical energy principle, i.e., minimizing\nhyperspherical energy during fine-tuning preserves the intrinsic structure of\nthe original parameter space, to prevent the destruction of the generalization\nability offered by the CLIP text encoder. Extensive evaluations across various\nbenchmarks show that H-CLIP achieves new SOTA open-vocabulary semantic\nsegmentation results while only requiring updating approximately 4% of the\ntotal parameters of CLIP.",

        "abstract": "The integration of human factors (HF) knowledge is crucial when developing\nsafety-critical systems, such as automated vehicles (AVs). Ensuring that HF\nknowledge is considered continuously throughout the AV development process is\nessential for several reasons, including efficacy, safety, and acceptance of\nthese advanced systems. However, it is challenging to include HF as\nrequirements in agile development. Recently, Requirements Strategies have been\nsuggested to address requirements engineering challenges in agile development.\nBy applying the concept of Requirements Strategies as a lens to the\ninvestigation of HF requirements in agile development of AVs, this paper\narrives at three areas for investigation: a) ownership and responsibility for\nHF requirements, b) structure of HF requirements and information models, and c)\ndefinition of work and feature flows related to HF requirements. Based on 13\nsemi-structured interviews with professionals from the global automotive\nindustry, we provide qualitative insights in these three areas. The diverse\nperspectives and experiences shared by the interviewees provide insightful\nviews and helped to reason about the potential solution spaces in each area for\nintegrating HF within the industry, highlighting the real-world practices and\nstrategies used.",

While theoretically\nsounded, topological optimization faces an important challenge: gradients tend\nto be extremely sparse, in the sense that the loss function typically depends\non only very few coordinates of the input object, yielding dramatically slow\noptimization schemes in practice.Focusing on the central case of topological\noptimization for point clouds, we propose in this work to overcome this\nlimitation using diffeomorphic interpolation, turning sparse gradients into\nsmooth vector fields defined on the whole space, with quantifiable Lipschitz\nconstants. In particular, we show that our approach combines efficiently with\nsubsampling techniques routinely used in TDA, as the diffeomorphism derived\nfrom the gradient computed on a subsample can be used to update the coordinates\nof the full input object, allowing us to perform topological optimization on\npoint clouds at an unprecedented scale. Finally, we also showcase the relevance\nof our approach for black-box autoencoder (AE) regularization, where we aim at\nenforcing topological priors on the latent spaces associated to fixed,\npre-trained, black-box AE models, and where we show thatlearning a\ndiffeomorphic flow can be done once and then re-applied to new data in linear\ntime (while vanilla topological optimization has to be re-run from scratch).\nMoreover, reverting the flow allows us to generate data by sampling the\ntopologically-optimized latent space directly, yielding better interpretability\nof the model.",

In this work, we\nintroduce MindSemantix, a novel multi-modal framework that enables LLMs to\ncomprehend visually-evoked semantic content in brain activity. Our MindSemantix\nexplores a more ideal brain captioning paradigm by weaving LLMs into brain\nactivity analysis, crafting a seamless, end-to-end Brain-Language Model. To\neffectively capture semantic information from brain responses, we propose\nBrain-Text Transformer, utilizing a Brain Q-Former as its core architecture.

To enhance the generalizability of neural representations, we\npre-train our brain encoder on a large-scale, cross-subject fMRI dataset using\nself-supervised learning techniques. MindSemantix provides more feasibility to\ndownstream brain decoding tasks such as stimulus reconstruction. Conditioned by\nMindSemantix captioning, our framework facilitates this process by integrating\nwith advanced generative models like Stable Diffusion and excels in\nunderstanding brain visual perception.

In the high precision regime\n$\\epsilon\\ll\\frac{1}{n}$ where we can even recover the exact solution, our\nalgorithm has a total runtime of $O\\left(mn\\log n\\right)$, matching the exact\nalgorithm via parametric flows (Gallo et al., 1989). Empirically, we show that\nthis algorithm is very practical and scales to very large graphs, and its\nperformance is competitive with widely used methods that have significantly\nweaker theoretical guarantees.",

        "abstract": "The human brain is a highly efficient processing unit, and understanding how\nit works can inspire new algorithms and architectures in machine learning. In\nthis work, we introduce a novel framework named Brain Activation Network\n(BRACTIVE), a transformer-based approach to studying the human visual brain.\nThe main objective of BRACTIVE is to align the visual features of subjects with\ncorresponding brain representations via fMRI signals. It allows us to identify\nthe brain's Regions of Interest (ROI) of the subjects. Unlike previous brain\nresearch methods, which can only identify ROIs for one subject at a time and\nare limited by the number of subjects, BRACTIVE automatically extends this\nidentification to multiple subjects and ROIs. Our experiments demonstrate that\nBRACTIVE effectively identifies person-specific regions of interest, such as\nface and body-selective areas, aligning with neuroscience findings and\nindicating potential applicability to various object categories. More\nimportantly, we found that leveraging human visual brain activity to guide deep\nneural networks enhances performance across various benchmarks. It encourages\nthe potential of BRACTIVE in both neuroscience and machine intelligence\nstudies.",

Our proposed TeleHand has a kinematic twin design to the DeltaHand\nthat enables precise one-to-one joint control of the DeltaHand during\nteleoperation. This facilitates efficient high-quality data collection of human\ndemonstrations in the real world. To evaluate the effectiveness of our system,\nwe demonstrate the fully autonomous closed-loop deployment of diffusion\npolicies learned from demonstrations across seven dexterous manipulation tasks\nwith an average 90% success rate.",

To bridge\nthese gaps, we propose integrating deep features from pre-trained visual models\nwith a statistical analysis model into a Multi-scale Deep Feature Statistics\n(MDFS) model for achieving opinion-unaware BIQA (OU-BIQA), thereby eliminating\nthe reliance on human rating data and significantly improving training\nefficiency.

        "abstract": "In cross-domain few-shot classification, \\emph{nearest centroid classifier}\n(NCC) aims to learn representations to construct a metric space where few-shot\nclassification can be performed by measuring the similarities between samples\nand the prototype of each class. An intuition behind NCC is that each sample is\npulled closer to the class centroid it belongs to while pushed away from those\nof other classes. However, in this paper, we find that there exist high\nsimilarities between NCC-learned representations of two samples from different\nclasses. In order to address this problem, we propose a bi-level optimization\nframework, \\emph{maximizing optimized kernel dependence} (MOKD) to learn a set\nof class-specific representations that match the cluster structures indicated\nby labeled data of the given task. Specifically, MOKD first optimizes the\nkernel adopted in \\emph{Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion} (HSIC) to\nobtain the optimized kernel HSIC (opt-HSIC) that can capture the dependence\nmore precisely. Then, an optimization problem regarding the opt-HSIC is\naddressed to simultaneously maximize the dependence between representations and\nlabels and minimize the dependence among all samples. Extensive experiments on\nMeta-Dataset demonstrate that MOKD can not only achieve better generalization\nperformance on unseen domains in most cases but also learn better data\nrepresentation clusters.

        "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the mainstream\nmethodologies for novel view synthesis (NVS) due to its high quality and fast\nrendering speed. However, as a point-based scene representation, 3DGS\npotentially generates a large number of Gaussians to fit the scene, leading to\nhigh memory usage. Improvements that have been proposed require either an\nempirical and preset pruning ratio or importance score threshold to prune the\npoint cloud. Such hyperparamter requires multiple rounds of training to\noptimize and achieve the maximum pruning ratio, while maintaining the rendering\nquality for each scene. In this work, we propose learning-to-prune 3DGS\n(LP-3DGS), where a trainable binary mask is applied to the importance score\nthat can find optimal pruning ratio automatically. Instead of using the\ntraditional straight-through estimator (STE) method to approximate the binary\nmask gradient, we redesign the masking function to leverage the Gumbel-Sigmoid\nmethod, making it differentiable and compatible with the existing training\nprocess of 3DGS. Extensive experiments have shown that LP-3DGS consistently\nproduces a good balance that is both efficient and high quality.",

        "abstract": "Self-attention is the key mechanism of transformers, which are the essential\nbuilding blocks of modern foundation models. Recent studies have shown that\npure self-attention suffers from an increasing degree of rank collapse as depth\nincreases, limiting model expressivity and further utilization of model depth.\nThe existing literature on rank collapse, however, has mostly overlooked other\ncritical components in transformers that may alleviate the rank collapse issue.\nIn this paper, we provide a general analysis of rank collapse under\nself-attention, taking into account the effects of attention masks and layer\nnormalization (LayerNorm). In particular, we find that although pure masked\nattention still suffers from exponential collapse to a rank one subspace, local\nmasked attention can provably slow down the collapse rate. In the case of\nself-attention with LayerNorm, we first show that for certain classes of value\nmatrices, collapse to a rank one subspace still happens exponentially. However,\nthrough construction of nontrivial counterexamples, we then establish that with\nproper choice of value matrices, a general class of sequences may not converge\nto a rank one subspace, and the self-attention dynamics with LayerNorm can\nsimultaneously possess a rich set of equilibria with any possible rank between\none and full. Our result refutes the previous hypothesis that LayerNorm plays\nno role in the rank collapse of self-attention and suggests that self-attention\nwith LayerNorm constitutes a much more expressive, versatile nonlinear\ndynamical system than what was originally thought.",

To address such limitations, we propose a novel Language Model-based\nOptimal Differential Privacy (LMO-DP) mechanism, which takes the first step to\nenable the tight composition of accurately fine-tuning (large) language models\nwith a sub-optimal DP mechanism, even in strong privacy regimes (e.g., $0.1\\leq\n\\epsilon<3$).

        "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed that vision-language (VL) models are vulnerable\nto adversarial attacks for image-text retrieval (ITR). However, existing\ndefense strategies for VL models primarily focus on zero-shot image\nclassification, which do not consider the simultaneous manipulation of image\nand text, as well as the inherent many-to-many (N:N) nature of ITR, where a\nsingle image can be described in numerous ways, and vice versa. To this end,\nthis paper studies defense strategies against adversarial attacks on VL models\nfor ITR for the first time. Particularly, we focus on how to leverage the N:N\nrelationship in ITR to enhance adversarial robustness. We found that, although\nadversarial training easily overfits to specific one-to-one (1:1) image-text\npairs in the train data, diverse augmentation techniques to create one-to-many\n(1:N) / many-to-one (N:1) image-text pairs can significantly improve\nadversarial robustness in VL models. Additionally, we show that the alignment\nof the augmented image-text pairs is crucial for the effectiveness of the\ndefense strategy, and that inappropriate augmentations can even degrade the\nmodel's performance. Based on these findings, we propose a novel defense\nstrategy that leverages the N:N relationship in ITR, which effectively\ngenerates diverse yet highly-aligned N:N pairs using basic augmentations and\ngenerative model-based augmentations. This work provides a novel perspective on\ndefending against adversarial attacks in VL tasks and opens up new research\ndirections for future work.",

Through experimental validation, we demonstrate\nhow this framework significantly improves the fidelity of generated images to\nthe user's intent, thereby expanding the models' creative capabilities and\nmitigating the risk of perpetuating biases. Our study contributes to the\nadvancement of text-to-image models as unbiased, versatile tools for creative\nexpression.",

Fulfilling\nthese requirements can be challenging in non-ideal real-world scenarios, where\nmotion-blurred images are commonly encountered in high-speed moving cameras or\nlow-light environments that require long exposure times. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Event Stream Assisted Gaussian Splatting\n(EvaGaussians), a novel approach that integrates event streams captured by an\nevent camera to assist in reconstructing high-quality 3D-GS from blurry images.\nCapitalizing on the high temporal resolution and dynamic range offered by the\nevent camera, we leverage the event streams to explicitly model the formation\nprocess of motion-blurred images and guide the deblurring reconstruction of\n3D-GS. By jointly optimizing the 3D-GS parameters and recovering camera motion\ntrajectories during the exposure time, our method can robustly facilitate the\nacquisition of high-fidelity novel views with intricate texture details.

        "abstract": "In the present era of deep learning, continual learning research is mainly\nfocused on mitigating forgetting when training a neural network with stochastic\ngradient descent on a non-stationary stream of data. On the other hand, in the\nmore classical literature of statistical machine learning, many models have\nsequential Bayesian update rules that yield the same learning outcome as the\nbatch training, i.e., they are completely immune to catastrophic forgetting.\nHowever, they are often overly simple to model complex real-world data. In this\nwork, we adopt the meta-learning paradigm to combine the strong\nrepresentational power of neural networks and simple statistical models'\nrobustness to forgetting. In our novel meta-continual learning framework,\ncontinual learning takes place only in statistical models via ideal sequential\nBayesian update rules, while neural networks are meta-learned to bridge the raw\ndata and the statistical models. Since the neural networks remain fixed during\ncontinual learning, they are protected from catastrophic forgetting. This\napproach not only achieves significantly improved performance but also exhibits\nexcellent scalability. Since our approach is domain-agnostic and\nmodel-agnostic, it can be applied to a wide range of problems and easily\nintegrated with existing model architectures.",

        "abstract": "Surgical robot task automation has been a promising research topic for\nimproving surgical efficiency and quality. Learning-based methods have been\nrecognized as an interesting paradigm and been increasingly investigated.\nHowever, existing approaches encounter difficulties in long-horizon\ngoal-conditioned tasks due to the intricate compositional structure, which\nrequires decision-making for a sequence of sub-steps and understanding of\ninherent dynamics of goal-reaching tasks. In this paper, we propose a new\nlearning-based framework by leveraging the strong reasoning capability of the\nGPT-based architecture to automate surgical robotic tasks. The key to our\napproach is developing a goal-conditioned decision transformer to achieve\nsequential representations with goal-aware future indicators in order to\nenhance temporal reasoning. Moreover, considering to exploit a general\nunderstanding of dynamics inherent in manipulations, thus making the model's\nreasoning ability to be task-agnostic, we also design a cross-task pretraining\nparadigm that uses multiple training objectives associated with data from\ndiverse tasks. We have conducted extensive experiments on 10 tasks using the\nsurgical robot learning simulator SurRoL~\\cite{long2023human}.

In this work, we fill this gap by establishing theoretical\nperformance guarantees, which reveal how the performance of the model is\nbounded by training losses of previous tasks in the contrastive continual\nlearning framework. Our theoretical explanations further support the idea that\npre-training can benefit continual learning.

However, the rapidly evolving nature of software and\ndependencies poses significant challenges to reproducing research results,\nparticularly in fields like adversarial robustness for deep neural networks,\nwhere complex codebases and specialized toolkits are utilized. This paper\npresents a case study of attempting to validate the results on certified\nadversarial robustness in \"SoK: Certified Robustness for Deep Neural Networks\"\nusing the VeriGauge toolkit. Despite following the documented methodology,\nnumerous software and hardware compatibility issues were encountered, including\noutdated or unavailable dependencies, version conflicts, and driver\nincompatibilities. While a subset of the original results could be run, key\nfindings related to the empirical robust accuracy of various verification\nmethods proved elusive due to these technical obstacles, as well as slight\ndiscrepancies in the test results. This practical experience sheds light on the\nreproducibility crisis afflicting adversarial robustness research, where a lack\nof reproducibility threatens scientific integrity and hinders progress. The\npaper discusses the broader implications of this crisis, proposing potential\nsolutions such as containerization, software preservation, and comprehensive\ndocumentation practices. Furthermore, it highlights the need for collaboration\nand standardization efforts within the research community to develop robust\nframeworks for reproducible research. By addressing the reproducibility crisis\nhead-on, this work aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on scientific\nreproducibility and advocate for best practices that ensure the reliability and\nvalidity of research findings within not only adversarial robustness, but\nsecurity and technology research as a whole.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of resilient average consensus in multi-agent systems\nwhere some of the agents are subject to failures or attacks. The objective of\nresilient average consensus is for non-faulty/normal agents to converge to the\naverage of their initial values despite the erroneous effects from malicious\nagents. To this end, we propose a successful distributed iterative resilient\naverage consensus algorithm for the multi-agent networks with general directed\ntopologies. The proposed algorithm has two parts at each iteration: detection\nand averaging. For the detection part, we propose two distributed algorithms\nand one of them can detect malicious agents with only the information from\ndirect in-neighbors. For the averaging part, we extend the applicability of an\nexisting averaging algorithm where normal agents can remove the effects from\nmalicious agents so far, after they are detected. Another important feature of\nour method is that it can handle the case where malicious agents are\nneighboring and collaborating with each other to mislead the normal ones from\naveraging. This case cannot be solved by existing detection approaches in\nrelated literature. Moreover, our algorithm is efficient in storage usage\nespecially for large-scale networks as each agent only requires the values of\nneighbors within two hops.

This vulnerability stems from the cloud\nprovider's full access to these circuits during training and/or inference. In\nthis work, we introduce STIQ, a novel ensemble-based strategy designed to\nsafeguard QNNs against such cloud-based adversaries. Our method innovatively\ntrains two distinct QNNs concurrently, hosting them on same or different\nplatforms, in a manner that each network yields obfuscated outputs rendering\nthe individual QNNs ineffective for adversaries operating within cloud\nenvironments.

This trade-off, however, is a small price to pay for\nthe enhanced security and integrity of QNNs in a cloud-based environment prone\nto untrusted adversaries.

However, LLMs create an even bigger black box\nexacerbating opacity, with interpretability limited to few approaches. The\nuncertainty and opacity embedded in LLMs' nature restrict their application in\nhigh-stakes domains like financial fraud, phishing, etc. Current approaches\nmainly rely on traditional textual classification with posterior interpretable\nalgorithms, suffering from attackers who may create versatile adversarial\nsamples to break the system's defense, forcing users to make trade-offs between\nefficiency and robustness. To address this issue, we propose a novel cascading\nframework called Genshin (General Shield for Natural Language Processing with\nLarge Language Models), utilizing LLMs as defensive one-time plug-ins. Unlike\nmost applications of LLMs that try to transform text into something new or\nstructural, Genshin uses LLMs to recover text to its original state. Genshin\naims to combine the generalizability of the LLM, the discrimination of the\nmedian model, and the interpretability of the simple model. Our experiments on\nthe task of sentimental analysis and spam detection have shown fatal flaws of\nthe current median models and exhilarating results on LLMs' recovery ability,\ndemonstrating that Genshin is both effective and efficient.

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a fundamental learning paradigm to\nharness massive data scattered at geo-distributed edge devices in a\nprivacy-preserving way. Given the heterogeneous deployment of edge devices,\nhowever, their data are usually Non-IID, introducing significant challenges to\nFL including degraded training accuracy, intensive communication costs, and\nhigh computing complexity. Towards that, traditional approaches typically\nutilize adaptive mechanisms, which may suffer from scalability issues,\nincreased computational overhead, and limited adaptability to diverse edge\nenvironments.

Specifically,\nFlocOff formulates the FL process with Non-IID data in edge scenarios and\nderives rigorous analysis on the impact of imbalanced data distribution. Based\non this, FlocOff decouples the optimization in two steps, namely : (1)\nMinimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence via Computation Offloading\nscheduling (MKL-CO); (2) Minimizes the Communication Cost through Resource\nAllocation (MCC-RA).

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18726v1",
        "abstract": "Drawing inspiration from the hierarchical processing of the human auditory\nsystem, which transforms sound from low-level acoustic features to high-level\nsemantic understanding, we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine audio\nreconstruction method. Leveraging non-invasive functional Magnetic Resonance\nImaging (fMRI) data, our approach mimics the inverse pathway of auditory\nprocessing. Initially, we utilize CLAP to decode fMRI data coarsely into a\nlow-dimensional semantic space, followed by a fine-grained decoding into the\nhigh-dimensional AudioMAE latent space guided by semantic features. These\nfine-grained neural features serve as conditions for audio reconstruction\nthrough a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Validation on three public fMRI\ndatasets-Brain2Sound, Brain2Music, and Brain2Speech-underscores the superiority\nof our coarse-to-fine decoding method over stand-alone fine-grained approaches,\nshowcasing state-of-the-art performance in metrics like FD, FAD, and KL.\nMoreover, by employing semantic prompts during decoding, we enhance the quality\nof reconstructed audio when semantic features are suboptimal. The demonstrated\nversatility of our model across diverse stimuli highlights its potential as a\nuniversal brain-to-audio framework. This research contributes to the\ncomprehension of the human auditory system, pushing boundaries in neural\ndecoding and audio reconstruction methodologies.",

        "abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has emerged as a prominent trend across various\ndomains. However, ensuring the quality of the sensing data submitted by mobile\nusers (MUs) remains a complex and challenging problem. To address this\nchallenge, an advanced method is required to detect low-quality sensing data\nand identify malicious MUs that may disrupt the normal operations of an MCS\nsystem. Therefore, this article proposes a prediction- and reputation-based\ntruth discovery (PRBTD) framework, which can separate low-quality data from\nhigh-quality data in sensing tasks. First, we apply a correlation-focused\nspatial-temporal transformer network to predict the ground truth of the input\nsensing data. Then, we extract the sensing errors of the data as features based\non the prediction results to calculate the implications among the data.\nFinally, we design a reputation-based truth discovery (TD) module for\nidentifying low-quality data with their implications. Given sensing data\nsubmitted by MUs, PRBTD can eliminate the data with heavy noise and identify\nmalicious MUs with high accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat PRBTD outperforms the existing methods in terms of identification accuracy\nand data quality enhancement.",

        "abstract": "Accurate prediction of molecular properties is critical in the field of drug\ndiscovery. However, existing methods do not fully consider the fact that\nmolecules in the real world usually possess multiple property labels, and\ncomplex high-order relationships may exist among these labels. Therefore,\nmolecular representation learning models should generate differential molecular\nrepresentations that consider multi-granularity correlation information among\ntasks. To this end, our research introduces a Hierarchical Prompted Molecular\nRepresentation Learning Framework (HiPM), which enhances the differential\nexpression of tasks in molecular representations through task-aware prompts,\nand utilizes shared information among labels to mitigate negative transfer\nbetween different tasks. HiPM primarily consists of two core components: the\nMolecular Representation Encoder (MRE) and the Task-Aware Prompter (TAP). The\nMRE employs a hierarchical message-passing network architecture to capture\nmolecular features at both the atomic and motif levels, while the TAP uses\nagglomerative hierarchical clustering to build a prompt tree that reflects the\naffinity and distinctiveness of tasks, enabling the model to effectively handle\nthe complexity of multi-label property predictions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that HiPM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various\nmulti-label datasets, offering a new perspective on multi-label molecular\nrepresentation learning.",

        "abstract": "While existing depression recognition methods based on deep learning show\npromise, their practical application is hindered by the lack of\ntrustworthiness, as these deep models are often deployed as \\textit{black box}\nmodels, leaving us uncertain about the confidence of the model predictions. For\nhigh-risk clinical applications like depression recognition, uncertainty\nquantification is essential in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce\nconformal depression prediction (CDP), a depression recognition method with\nuncertainty quantification based on conformal prediction (CP), giving valid\nconfidence intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees for the model\npredictions. CDP is a plug-and-play module that requires neither model\nretraining nor an assumption about the depression data distribution. As CDP\nprovides only an average performance guarantee across all inputs rather than\nper-input performance guarantee, we propose CDP-ACC, an improved conformal\nprediction with approximate conditional coverage. CDP-ACC firstly estimates the\nprediction distribution through neighborhood relaxation, and then introduces a\nconformal score function by constructing nested sequences, so as to provide\ntighter prediction interval for each specific input. We empirically demonstrate\nthe application of uncertainty quantification in depression recognition, and\nthe effectiveness and superiority of CDP and CDP-ACC on the AVEC 2013 and AVEC\n2014 datasets",

        "abstract": "Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) requires the agent to follow language\ninstructions to reach a target position. A key factor for successful navigation\nis to align the landmarks implied in the instruction with diverse visual\nobservations. However, previous VLN agents fail to perform accurate modality\nalignment especially in unexplored scenes, since they learn from limited\nnavigation data and lack sufficient open-world alignment knowledge. In this\nwork, we propose a new VLN paradigm, called COrrectable LaNdmark DiScOvery via\nLarge ModEls (CONSOLE). In CONSOLE, we cast VLN as an open-world sequential\nlandmark discovery problem, by introducing a novel correctable landmark\ndiscovery scheme based on two large models ChatGPT and CLIP. Specifically, we\nuse ChatGPT to provide rich open-world landmark cooccurrence commonsense, and\nconduct CLIP-driven landmark discovery based on these commonsense priors. To\nmitigate the noise in the priors due to the lack of visual constraints, we\nintroduce a learnable cooccurrence scoring module, which corrects the\nimportance of each cooccurrence according to actual observations for accurate\nlandmark discovery. We further design an observation enhancement strategy for\nan elegant combination of our framework with different VLN agents, where we\nutilize the corrected landmark features to obtain enhanced observation features\nfor action decision. Extensive experimental results on multiple popular VLN\nbenchmarks (R2R, REVERIE, R4R, RxR) show the significant superiority of CONSOLE\nover strong baselines.

        "abstract": "The attention mechanism is a critical component of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) that allows tokens in a sequence to interact with each other, but is\norder-invariant. Incorporating position encoding (PE) makes it possible to\naddress by position, such as attending to the i-th token. However, current PE\nmethods use token counts to derive position, and thus cannot generalize to\nhigher levels of abstraction, such as attending to the i-th sentence. In this\npaper, we propose a new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding\n(CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing\nposition only on certain tokens determined by the model. This allows more\ngeneral position addressing such as attending to the $i$-th particular word,\nnoun, or sentence. We show that CoPE can solve the selective copy, counting and\nFlip-Flop tasks where popular position embeddings fail, and improves perplexity\non language modeling and coding tasks.",

        "abstract": "With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), alignment has\nemerged as an effective technique for keeping LLMs consensus with human intent.\nCurrent methods primarily involve direct training through Supervised\nFine-tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), both of\nwhich require substantial computational resources and extensive ground truth\ndata. This paper explores an efficient method for aligning black-box large\nmodels using smaller models, introducing a model-agnostic and lightweight\nBayesian Persuasion Alignment framework. We formalize this problem as an\noptimization of the signaling strategy from the small model's perspective. In\nthe persuasion process, the small model (Advisor) observes the information item\n(i.e., state) and persuades large models (Receiver) to elicit improved\nresponses. The Receiver then generates a response based on the input, the\nsignal from the Advisor, and its updated belief about the information item.\nThrough training using our framework, we demonstrate that the Advisor can\nsignificantly enhance the performance of various Receivers across a range of\ntasks. We theoretically analyze our persuasion framework and provide an upper\nbound on the Advisor's regret, confirming its effectiveness in learning the\noptimal signaling strategy. Our Empirical results demonstrates that GPT-2 can\nsignificantly improve the performance of various models, achieving an average\nenhancement of 16.1% in mathematical reasoning ability and 13.7% in code\ngeneration.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in\nvarious reasoning tasks, aided by techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT)\nprompting that elicits verbalized reasoning. However, LLMs often generate text\nwith obvious mistakes and contradictions, raising doubts about their ability to\nrobustly process and utilize generated rationales. In this work, we investigate\nCoT reasoning in LLMs through the lens of internal representations, focusing on\nhow these representations are influenced by generated rationales. Our\npreliminary analysis reveals that while generated rationales improve answer\naccuracy, inconsistencies emerge between the model's internal representations\nin middle layers and those in final layers, potentially undermining the\nreliability of their reasoning processes. To address this, we propose internal\nconsistency as a measure of the model's confidence by examining the agreement\nof latent predictions decoded from intermediate layers. Extensive empirical\nstudies across different models and datasets demonstrate that internal\nconsistency effectively distinguishes between correct and incorrect reasoning\npaths. Motivated by this, we propose a new approach to calibrate CoT reasoning\nby up-weighting reasoning paths with high internal consistency, resulting in a\nsignificant boost in reasoning performance. Further analysis uncovers distinct\npatterns in attention and feed-forward modules across layers, providing\ninsights into the emergence of internal inconsistency.

        "abstract": "The massive computational costs associated with large language model (LLM)\npretraining have spurred great interest in reduced-precision floating-point\nrepresentations to accelerate the process. As a result, the BrainFloat16 (BF16)\nprecision has become the de facto standard for LLM training, with hardware\nsupport included in recent accelerators. This trend has gone even further in\nthe latest processors, where FP8 has recently been introduced. However, prior\nexperience with FP16, which was found to be less stable than BF16, raises\nconcerns as to whether FP8, with even fewer bits than FP16, can be a\ncost-effective option for LLM training. We argue that reduced-precision\ntraining schemes must have similar training stability and hyperparameter\nsensitivities to their higher-precision counterparts in order to be\ncost-effective. However, we find that currently available methods for FP8\ntraining are not robust enough to allow their use as economical replacements.\nThis prompts us to investigate the stability of reduced-precision LLM training\nin terms of robustness across random seeds and learning rates.

        "abstract": "Feature interaction selection is a fundamental problem in commercial\nrecommender systems. Most approaches equally enumerate all features and\ninteractions by the same pre-defined operation under expert guidance. Their\nrecommendation is unsatisfactory sometimes due to the following issues:\n(1)~They cannot ensure the learning abilities of models because their\narchitectures are poorly adaptable to tasks and data; (2)~Useless features and\ninteractions can bring unnecessary noise and complicate the training process.\nIn this paper, we aim to adaptively evolve the model to select appropriate\noperations, features, and interactions under task guidance. Inspired by the\nevolution and functioning of natural organisms, we propose a novel\n\\textsl{Cognitive EvoLutionary Learning (CELL)} framework, where cognitive\nability refers to a property of organisms that allows them to react and survive\nin diverse environments. It consists of three stages, i.e., DNA search, genome\nsearch, and model functioning. Specifically, if we regard the relationship\nbetween models and tasks as the relationship between organisms and natural\nenvironments, interactions of feature pairs can be analogous to double-stranded\nDNA, of which relevant features and interactions can be analogous to genomes.\nAlong this line, we diagnose the fitness of the model on operations, features,\nand interactions to simulate the survival rates of organisms for natural\nselection. We show that CELL can adaptively evolve into different models for\ndifferent tasks and data, which enables practitioners to access off-the-shelf\nmodels. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that CELL\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Also, we conduct\nsynthetic experiments to ascertain that CELL can consistently discover the\npre-defined interaction patterns for feature pairs.",

        "abstract": "Vehicular edge intelligence (VEI) is a promising paradigm for enabling future\nintelligent transportation systems by accommodating artificial intelligence\n(AI) at the vehicular edge computing (VEC) system. Federated learning (FL)\nstands as one of the fundamental technologies facilitating collaborative model\ntraining locally and aggregation, while safeguarding the privacy of vehicle\ndata in VEI. However, traditional FL faces challenges in adapting to vehicle\nheterogeneity, training large models on resource-constrained vehicles, and\nremaining susceptible to model weight privacy leakage. Meanwhile, split\nlearning (SL) is proposed as a promising collaborative learning framework which\ncan mitigate the risk of model wights leakage, and release the training\nworkload on vehicles. SL sequentially trains a model between a vehicle and an\nedge cloud (EC) by dividing the entire model into a vehicle-side model and an\nEC-side model at a given cut layer. In this work, we combine the advantages of\nSL and FL to develop an Adaptive Split Federated Learning scheme for Vehicular\nEdge Computing (ASFV). The ASFV scheme adaptively splits the model and\nparallelizes the training process, taking into account mobile vehicle selection\nand resource allocation. Our extensive simulations, conducted on\nnon-independent and identically distributed data, demonstrate that the proposed\nASFV solution significantly reduces training latency compared to existing\nbenchmarks, while adapting to network dynamics and vehicles' mobility.",

        "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) marks a notable milestone in segmentation\nmodels, highlighted by its robust zero-shot capabilities and ability to handle\ndiverse prompts. SAM follows a pipeline that separates interactive segmentation\ninto image preprocessing through a large encoder and interactive inference via\na lightweight decoder, ensuring efficient real-time performance. However, SAM\nfaces stability issues in challenging samples upon this pipeline. These issues\narise from two main factors. Firstly, the image preprocessing disables SAM from\ndynamically using image-level zoom-in strategies to refocus on the target\nobject during interaction. Secondly, the lightweight decoder struggles to\nsufficiently integrate interactive information with image embeddings. To\naddress these two limitations, we propose FocSAM with a pipeline redesigned on\ntwo pivotal aspects. First, we propose Dynamic Window Multi-head Self-Attention\n(Dwin-MSA) to dynamically refocus SAM's image embeddings on the target object.\nDwin-MSA localizes attention computations around the target object, enhancing\nobject-related embeddings with minimal computational overhead. Second, we\npropose Pixel-wise Dynamic ReLU (P-DyReLU) to enable sufficient integration of\ninteractive information from a few initial clicks that have significant impacts\non the overall segmentation results. Experimentally, FocSAM augments SAM's\ninteractive segmentation performance to match the existing state-of-the-art\nmethod in segmentation quality, requiring only about 5.6% of this method's\ninference time on CPUs.",

        "abstract": "Many real-world decision problems involve interaction of multiple\nself-interested agents with limited sensing ability. The partially observable\nstochastic game (POSG) provides a mathematical framework for posing these\nproblems, however solving a POSG requires difficult reasoning about two\ncritical factors: (1) information revealed by partial observations and (2)\ndecisions other agents make. In the single agent case, partially observable\nMarkov decision process (POMDP) planning can efficiently address partial\nobservability with particle filtering.

However, real-world human movements are goal-directed and highly\ninfluenced by the spatial layout of their surrounding scenes. In this paper,\ninstead of planning future human motion in a 'dark' room, we propose a\nMulti-Condition Latent Diffusion network (MCLD) that reformulates the human\nmotion prediction task as a multi-condition joint inference problem based on\nthe given historical 3D body motion and the current 3D scene contexts.\nSpecifically, instead of directly modeling joint distribution over the raw\nmotion sequences, MCLD performs a conditional diffusion process within the\nlatent embedding space, characterizing the cross-modal mapping from the past\nbody movement and current scene context condition embeddings to the future\nhuman motion embedding. Extensive experiments on large-scale human motion\nprediction datasets demonstrate that our MCLD achieves significant improvements\nover the state-of-the-art methods on both realistic and diverse predictions.",

        "abstract": "There are several challenges in developing a model for multi-tasking humanoid\ncontrol. Reinforcement learning and imitation learning approaches are quite\npopular in this domain. However, there is a trade-off between the two.\nReinforcement learning is not the best option for training a humanoid to\nperform multiple behaviors due to training time and model size, and imitation\nlearning using kinematics data alone is not appropriate to realize the actual\nphysics of the motion. Training models to perform multiple complex tasks take\nlong training time due to high DoF and complexities of the movements. Although\ntraining models offline would be beneficial, another issue is the size of the\ndataset, usually being quite large to encapsulate multiple movements. Many\npapers have implemented state of the art deep learning models such as\ntransformers to control humanoid characters and predict their motion based on a\nlarge dataset of recorded/reference motion. In this paper, we train a GPT on a\nlarge dataset of noisy expert policy rollout observations from a humanoid\nmotion dataset as a pre-trained model and fine tune that model on a smaller\ndataset of noisy expert policy rollout observations and actions to\nautoregressively generate physically plausible motion trajectories.

Domestic robots are\ngenerally welcomed for their role in easing human labor, in contrast to\nindustrial robots, which are frequently criticized for displacing human\nworkers. But before these robots can carry out domestic chores, they need to\nbecome proficient in several minor activities, such as recognizing their\nsurroundings, making decisions, and picking up on human behaviors.\nReinforcement learning, or RL, has emerged as a key robotics technology that\nenables robots to interact with their environment and learn how to optimize\ntheir actions to maximize rewards. However, the goal of Deep Reinforcement\nLearning is to address more complicated, continuous action-state spaces in\nreal-world settings by combining RL with Neural Networks. The efficacy of\nDeepRL can be further augmented through interactive feedback, in which a\ntrainer offers real-time guidance to expedite the robot's learning process.\nNevertheless, the current methods have drawbacks, namely the transient\napplication of guidance that results in repeated learning under identical\nconditions. Therefore, we present a novel method to preserve and reuse\ninformation and advice via Deep Interactive Reinforcement Learning, which\nutilizes a persistent rule-based system. This method not only expedites the\ntraining process but also lessens the number of repetitions that instructors\nwill have to carry out.

Focusing on the solution of the flow map differential equation as the\ndiffeomorphic deformation, recent methods use discrete timesteps along with\nvarious regularization terms to penalize the negative determinant of Jacobian\nand impose smoothness of the solution vector field. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel learning-based approach for diffeomorphic 3D-image registration which\nfinds the diffeomorphisms in the time continuum with fewer regularization terms\nand no additional integration. As one of the fundamental properties of flow\nmaps, we exploit the semigroup property as the only form of regularization,\nensuring temporally continuous diffeomorphic flows between pairs of images.\nLeveraging this property, our method alleviates the need for additional\nregularization terms and scaling and squaring integration during both training\nand evaluation. To achieve time-continuous diffeomorphisms, we employ\ntime-embedded UNets, a technique commonly utilized in diffusion models. The\nproposed method reveals that ensuring diffeomorphism in a continuous time\ninterval leads to better registration results. Experimental results on two\npublic datasets (OASIS and CANDI) demonstrate the superiority of our model over\nboth learning-based and optimization-based methods.",

        "abstract": "There has been significant recent interest in graph-based nearest neighbor\nsearch methods, many of which are centered on the construction of navigable\ngraphs over high-dimensional point sets. A graph is navigable if we can\nsuccessfully move from any starting node to any target node using a greedy\nrouting strategy where we always move to the neighbor that is closest to the\ndestination according to a given distance function. The complete graph is\nnavigable for any point set, but the important question for applications is if\nsparser graphs can be constructed. While this question is fairly well\nunderstood in low-dimensions, we establish some of the first upper and lower\nbounds for high-dimensional point sets. First, we give a simple and efficient\nway to construct a navigable graph with average degree $O(\\sqrt{n \\log n })$\nfor any set of $n$ points, in any dimension, for any distance function. We\ncompliment this result with a nearly matching lower bound: even under the\nEuclidean metric in $O(\\log n)$ dimensions, a random point set has no navigable\ngraph with average degree $O(n^{\\alpha})$ for any $\\alpha < 1/2$. Our lower\nbound relies on sharp anti-concentration bounds for binomial random variables,\nwhich we use to show that the near-neighborhoods of a set of random points do\nnot overlap significantly, forcing any navigable graph to have many edges.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, State Space Models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware\ndesigns, known as the Mamba deep learning models, have made significant\nprogress in modeling long sequences such as language understanding. Therefore,\nbuilding efficient and general-purpose visual backbones based on SSMs is a\npromising direction. Compared to traditional convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), the performance of Vision Mamba (ViM)\nmethods is not yet fully competitive. To enable SSMs to process image data,\nViMs typically flatten 2D images into 1D sequences, inevitably ignoring some 2D\nlocal dependencies, thereby weakening the model's ability to interpret spatial\nrelationships from a global perspective. We use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to\nobtain the spectrum of the feature map and add it to the original feature map,\nenabling ViM to model a unified visual representation in both frequency and\nspatial domains. The introduction of frequency domain information enables ViM\nto have a global receptive field during scanning. We propose a novel model\ncalled Vim-F, which employs pure Mamba encoders and scans in both the frequency\nand spatial domains. Moreover, we question the necessity of position embedding\nin ViM and remove it accordingly in Vim-F, which helps to fully utilize the\nefficient long-sequence modeling capability of ViM. Finally, we redesign a\npatch embedding for Vim-F, leveraging a convolutional stem to capture more\nlocal correlations, further improving the performance of Vim-F.

Additionally, we modify the self-attention mechanism\nto integrate information from the source view, reducing shape distortions.\nThese processes are further supported by a specialized sampling schedule.\nExperimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in fidelity and\nconsistency, validated on a diverse set of out-of-distribution objects.",
